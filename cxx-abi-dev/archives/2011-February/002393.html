OK.

&gt;<i> There's a fix to this, which is to make this a function pointer in the
</I>&gt;<i> RTTI object instead.
</I>
OK.

&gt;<i> This proposal would require us to instantiate and emit the copy

</I>&gt;<i> by the current language spec, so we'd need language sanction for this.
</I>&gt;<i> This is also a potentially significant code-size and compile-time issue.
</I>
Right. I had overlooked that.

&gt;<i> Proposal 2 (prepending fields to the exception data).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is a somewhat more elegant implementation choice,
</I>&gt;<i> particularly since the original design was intended to be extended in
</I>&gt;<i> this way, and it's been done before on some major platforms (in service
</I>&gt;<i> of std::rethrow_exception, in fact).
</I>
That's good to know, thanks.

&gt;<i> We'd need a new __cxa_throw variant called something like
</I>&gt;<i> __cxa_throw_copyable. I presume that throwing a trivially-copyable class
</I>&gt;<i> would pass a null copy-ctor to the new variant, whereas throwing a class
</I>&gt;<i> with an inaccessible or deleted copy ctor would just use __cxa_throw.
</I>&gt;<i> Code throwing a non-class would still be allowed to throw with
</I>&gt;<i> __cxa_throw, and std::rethrow_exception would just have to look for such
</I>&gt;<i> types and DTRT.
</I>
Yes, that seems in keeping with my expectations.

&gt;<i> Under either proposal, the C++0x standard library would need to export
</I>&gt;<i> new symbols (either the new vtables or a new __cxa_throw variant) which
</I>&gt;<i> would be used by a lot of code compiled for '0x regardless of whether
</I>&gt;<i> that code actually used std::rethrow_exception. This means that programs
</I>&gt;<i> compiled for '0x would not be able to link against an '03 standard
</I>&gt;<i> library even if they didn't actually use any '0x features requiring
</I>&gt;<i> runtime support, which is actually a pretty serious concern. It's a much
</I>&gt;<i> bigger problem for Proposal 1, where all code emitting RTTI for classes
</I>&gt;<i> with public copy ctors would suddenly use the new symbols, whereas
</I>&gt;<i> Proposal 2 would only affect code that actually contains throws.
</I>
Yes, this would be the case. However, C++03 code should still be able to 
link against the C++0x library unless there are other incompatible 
changes, so replacing the standard library with the C++0x one would work 
with all such code.

In many cases, code compiled for C++0x will also use other C++0x 
facilities that require the C++0x runtime anyway, but I accept that this 
will not necessarily be the case for existing C++03 code recompiled with 
the new compiler.
