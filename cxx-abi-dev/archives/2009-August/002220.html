Hi Janis,

The fundamental problem is not limited to &lt;decimal&gt;.  Similar
issues exist for &lt;complex&gt;.  One could argue that the C99 committee
did not care about compabitility, or that the C++ committee did not
care about compability.  I think that would be beside the point.
I'm not sure that C99 would have made the same decisions if they
had as powerful abstraction mechanisms as C++.

Anyway, C++0x has the notion of &quot;literal types&quot;.  For example complex&lt;double&gt;
is a literal type.  Concretely, what it means is that the compiler can
manipulate
values of such type at compile time (there is nothing that prevents the decimal
types from being such types.)  an ABI that aims at efficient support of C++
could (and should) treat literal types very efficiently as opposed to saying
&quot;oh, this is a struct, let's not make it faster than in C&quot;.  For
example, the ABI
could define the parameter passing mechanism as equivalent to that
of the underlying representation -- even on IA32.  In this case, it
would mean no
difference between the C and C++ versions, even if in C++ it is a
class -- the key
point being that it is not just a random struct: it is a literal type.
