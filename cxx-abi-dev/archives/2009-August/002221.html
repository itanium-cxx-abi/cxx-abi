</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm investigating support for decimal floating-point arithmetic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in G++ and sent similar mail to the GCC mailing list last
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; month, where Jason Merrill suggested that this might be a more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appropriate discussion venue.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GCC currently supports decimal floating point functionality
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in C for several targets based on ISO/IEC TR 24732.  The C
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support adds 3 new scalar types: _Decimal32, _Decimal64, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; _Decimal128.  With minor changes to GCC, including support for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mangling those types, and changes to tests to define typedefs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the underlying type modes, G++ already passes almost all of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GCC's decimal float tests for C.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The C++ standards committee defined quite different support
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for C++ in ISO/IEC DTR 24733, &quot;Extension for the programming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; language C++ to support decimal floating-point arithmetic&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It defines the support in terms of classes decimal32, decimal64,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and decimal128 in namespace decimal, defined in &lt;decimal&gt;, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allows decimal floating-point literals as a conforming extension.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If the libstdc++ implmentation of the decimal classes can depend
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on compiler support for the decimal float type modes then the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support is straightforward, with classes that contain a data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; member of the appropriate mode.  The only tricky part I've
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; run into is passing arguments and return values in a way that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is compatible with C, since one is a scalar and the other is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a class.  This affects not just intercallability between user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code written in C and C++, but also access to the decimal float
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; math functions defined for both C and C++.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Given that libstdc++ is used with compilers other than G++, is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it reasonable to depend on non-standard C++ compiler support?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; An alternative is for the libstdc++ support to use decNumber
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and/or libbid libraries, but that would be less efficient and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more time- consuming to implement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Both TRs are available online:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; C:   <A HREF="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1312.pdf">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1312.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; C++: <A HREF="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2849.pdf">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2849.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The fundamental problem is not limited to &lt;decimal&gt;.  Similar
</I>&gt;<i> issues exist for &lt;complex&gt;.  One could argue that the C99 committee
</I>&gt;<i> did not care about compabitility, or that the C++ committee did not
</I>&gt;<i> care about compability.  I think that would be beside the point.
</I>
Actually, I think the primary problem here is that the C++ definition
came first, and the path of least resistance in the ABI was to
simply represent it as a struct.  C99 came along and folks expected
compatiblity with Fortran, which was not struct-like.

&gt;<i> I'm not sure that C99 would have made the same decisions if they
</I>&gt;<i> had as powerful abstraction mechanisms as C++.
</I>
Actually, C99 didn't need the abstraction mechanisms to ensure a high
degree of compatibility.  All they needed was to define the spelling
of &quot;float _Complex&quot; as &quot;complex&lt;float&gt;&quot;.  Having an ability to name
types with template-like syntax does not imply supporting templates.

&gt;<i> Anyway, C++0x has the notion of &quot;literal types&quot;.  For example
</I>&gt;<i> complex&lt;double&gt; is a literal type.  Concretely, what it means is
</I>&gt;<i> that the compiler can manipulate values of such type at compile
</I>&gt;<i> time (there is nothing that prevents the decimal types from being
</I>&gt;<i> such types.)  An ABI that aims at efficient support of C++ could
</I>&gt;<i> (and should) treat literal types very efficiently as opposed to
</I>&gt;<i> saying &quot;oh, this is a struct, let's not make it faster than in C&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, the ABI could define the parameter passing mechanism
</I>&gt;<i> as equivalent to that of the underlying representation -- even
</I>&gt;<i> on IA32.
</I>
Many of the more modern ABIs have very little performance difference
between a native type and a struct of the native type.  Sadly,
IA32 is too old for such a benefit.

&gt;<i> In this case, it would mean no difference between the C and C++
</I>&gt;<i> versions, even if in C++ it is a class -- the key point being
</I>&gt;<i> that it is not just a random struct: it is a literal type.
