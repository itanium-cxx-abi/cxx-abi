<PRE>We discussed issues B5 (where to emit vtables), C2 (ordering of
static constructors), and B2 (covariant return type).

Action items: I agreed to write up a description of a priority
scheme for C2, and Jason agreed to write up a description of a
simple scheme for B2, including a proof that the simpler scheme
would be correct (albeit slow) for some of the ghastly cases that
Daveed has been considering.


B5. WHERE ARE VTABLES EMITTED

Consensus so far: use a heuristic for vtable and typeinfo emission,
based on the definition of the key function.  (The first virtual
function that is not declared inline in the class definition.)  The
vtable must be emitted where the key function is defined, it may also
be emitted in other translation units as well.  If there is no key
function then the vtable must be emitted in any translation unit that
refers to the vtable in any way.

Implication: the linker must be prepared to discard duplicate vtables.
We want to use COMDAT sections for this (and for other entities with
vague linkage.)

Open issue: the elf format allows only 16 bits for section identifiers,
and typically two of those bits are already taken up for other things.
So we've only got 16k sections available, which is unacceptable if we're
creating lots of small sections.

Jason - COMDATs disappear into text and data at link time, so the issue
is really only serious if we've got more than 16k vtables (or template
instantiations, etc.) in a single translation unit.

Daveed - HP has gotten around this problem by hacking their ELF files
to steal another 8 bits from somewhere else.

Jack - a new kind of section table could be a viable solution.  However,
it would break everything if we did it for ia32.  Is a solution that only
works on ia64 acceptable?  Note also that the elf section table has its own
string table, which we wouldn't be able to share with the new kind of
section table.  Index and link fields often point into section table, we
would have to figure out how to deal with this.  (Jack is not opposed to
the idea of an alternate section table, he is just pointing out some of the
issues we will have to resolve.)

Status: issue is still open.

C2. ORDER OF CTORS/DTORS

Cygnus scheme: priorities are 16-bit unsigned integers, lower numbers are
higher priority.  In each translation unit, there's a single initialization
function for each priority.  Anything that's prioritized has a higher
priority than anything that isn't explicitly assigned a priority.  IBM
scheme: priorities are 32-bit signed integers, higher numbers are higher
priority.  Something that isn't explicitly assigned a priority effectively
gets a priority of 0.

Consensus: nobody is sure that negative priorities are very important, but
also nobody can think of a reason not to allow them.  We accept the idea
that priorities are 32-bit signed integers.  On a source level Cygnus will
keep lower numbers as higher priority, but that's a source issue, not an
ABI issue.

Status: No real technical issues, we have consensus on everything that
matters.  We need to write up the finicky details.



B2. COVARIANT RETURN TYPES

Daveed presented his multiple-return-value scheme, including an example
that involved virtual base classes, return values that are pointers to
nonpolymorphic classes, and other equally horrible things.

Consensus: we need to get the horrible cases correct, but speed only
matters in the simple case.  The simple case: class B has a virtual
function f returning a B1* and class D has a virtual function f
returning a D1*, where all four classes are polymorphic, B is a primary
base of D, and B1 is a primary base of D1.  (The really important case
is where B1 is B and D1 is D, but that simplification doesn't make any
difference.)

Jason: Would the usual multiple-entry-point scheme work just as well?
That is, would it be just as fast as Daveed's scheme in the simple
case, and still preserve enough information for the more complicated
cases?  It appears so, but we don't have a proof.  Jason will try to
provide one.
