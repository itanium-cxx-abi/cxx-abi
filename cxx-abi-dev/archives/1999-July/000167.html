<PRE>&gt;<i> C2. ORDER OF CTORS/DTORS
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cygnus scheme: priorities are 16-bit unsigned integers, lower numbers are
</I>&gt;<i> higher priority.  In each translation unit, there's a single initialization
</I>&gt;<i> function for each priority.  Anything that's prioritized has a higher
</I>&gt;<i> priority than anything that isn't explicitly assigned a priority.  IBM
</I>&gt;<i> scheme: priorities are 32-bit signed integers, higher numbers are higher
</I>&gt;<i> priority.  Something that isn't explicitly assigned a priority effectively
</I>&gt;<i> gets a priority of 0.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Consensus: nobody is sure that negative priorities are very important, but
</I>&gt;<i> also nobody can think of a reason not to allow them.  We accept the idea
</I>&gt;<i> that priorities are 32-bit signed integers.  On a source level Cygnus will
</I>&gt;<i> keep lower numbers as higher priority, but that's a source issue, not an
</I>&gt;<i> ABI issue.
</I>
Am I missing something?  If we want to mix objects, consistent
treatment of the priorities will matter.  I suppose we could agree on
the binary treatment without agreeing on the source representation,
but it seems much better to also agree on a source form, even if some
existing compilers still need to map old forms to the new one.
