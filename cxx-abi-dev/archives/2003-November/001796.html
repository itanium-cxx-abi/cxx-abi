What I recall the ABI intended to convey, though obviously it
isn't clear enough, was that order-insensitive vendor qualifiers
were to be treated just like the predefined qualifiers const and
volatile.  That is, the substitutions permitted are two: one for
the bare type, and one for the final type with all of its
order-insensitive qualifiers.

We did not want to &quot;waste&quot; substitutions on the intermediate
qualifications, and wanted to avoid multiple substitutions for
different orderings of order-indifferent sets of qualifiers.

Order-sensitive qualifiers present a significant complication.
I don't recall clearly, but I think our intent was just to avoid
substituting them entirely to avoid any ambiguity.  One would
therefore end up with a substitution for the bare type, and
explicit qualifiers.  Perhaps others that were involved have
a clearer recollection, though.
