There are two reasons for this.

Firstly, the only reason that order matters in the mangled name
is in order not to have two different symbols that essentially
are the same type.  Thus:

int const volatile

and

int volatile const

much be mangled in the same way (because they ARE the same type,
you cannot overload a function by exchanging these qualifiers).
That includes all vendor specified qualifiers.

However, after all order-insensitive qualifiers are _uniquely_
ordered for the purpose of getting only a different symbol
name when they really are different, that order doesn't matter
anymore: Why not keep them in the order that they are put in?
So, a demangle should simply demangle these symbols as-if the
order is important (this is reason 1).

It does matter for the substitutions however; and the second
reason that vendor specified symbols are handled as 100%
order sensitive (which means they are NOT combined with CV-
qualifiers to make a single substitution) is because of the
grammar definition:

&lt;type&gt; ::=

[...]
	&lt;substitution&gt;
	&lt;CV-qualifiers&gt; &lt;type&gt;
	U &lt;source-name&gt; &lt;type&gt;
[...]

The standard says &quot;everything that can be a &lt;substitution&gt;
form a substitution itself&quot;.  Therefore 'U &lt;source-name&gt; &lt;type&gt;'
must be a substitution by itself, for any &lt;type&gt;, including
&lt;CV-qualifiers&gt; &lt;type&gt;.  And thus will
U &lt;source-name&gt; &lt;CV-qualifiers&gt; &lt;type&gt;
cause two substitutions.

The text that you quoted says
&gt;<i>   Also, note that the grammar above is written
</I>&gt;<i>   with the assumption that vendor extended type qualifiers will be in
</I>&gt;<i>   the order-sensitive (not CV) set.
</I>but this grammar is not given - and thus nobody implemented it.

I agree that this is a lack in the ABI that cannot be solved
by the demangler - lets just hope that the compiler WILL add
a substitution for every order-insensitive vendor qualifier,
unlike what the ABI says - otherwise all demanglers will break.
If they do that, then there is no problem.
