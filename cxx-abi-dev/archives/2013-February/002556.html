Gaby, I'd to clarify again that I am not actually proposing that we do
anything about the uniqueness of RTTI objects (_ZTSs and _ZTIs),
despite the widespread divergence.  The widespread divergence is a
problem that we need to address eventually, because it does seriously
affect the interoperation of compilers, but it's not why I'm posting now.

I am currently seeking consensus that we never meant to guarantee
uniqueness of *v-tables* (_ZTVs and _ZTTs).  I thought this would be
uncontroversial.  If it isn't, then I agree that I should come back with a
more formalized proposal.

I do know that there's code out there which loads and compares v-table
pointers &#8212; for example, WebKit's JavaScript engine used to do that,
although IIRC those types had key functions.  Of course, that code has
to either perform undefined behavior (by accessing the byte representation
of a polymorphic class) or escape the guarantees of the standards (by
using assembly), so I'm not too concerned about it, especially since many
existing compilers don't currently guarantee the uniqueness of v-tables
in all cases anyway (e.g. across dynamic library boundaries).

John.
