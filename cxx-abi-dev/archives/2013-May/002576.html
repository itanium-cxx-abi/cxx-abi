<PRE>Apropos of the recent discussion, I'd like to propose a small number of related changes to our description of POD types and layout.

1.  bool

We should specify that bool is the same type as the C99 type _Bool if the base ABI supports that.  This matters for, e.g., PPC32, where _Bool is sometimes 32 bits.

2.  Empty classes

We should specify the size and alignment of empty classes in case the base ABI does not.

I'll just note here that the entire ABI generally has not kept up with the reality of explicit alignment attributes, but that's a topic for another time.

3.  Discussion of language revisions

I'd like to change the wording of the note in the definition of &quot;POD for the purposes of layout&quot; to clarify that the ABI has permanently adopted the C++03 definition of POD and will not adopt the C++11 definition.  I believe that's still the consensus position of this list.

I would like to note that, contra previous discussion on this list, this does not appear to affect formal language compliance.  Specifically, a compiler which allocates other objects into the tail-padding of a base-class subobject is still fully compliant with the standard, even if that subobject has POD type.  The reason is that, while the language does make guarantees about copying the bytes of POD types (trivially-copyable types in C++11), these guarantees specifically should not apply to base-class subobjects.  Lawyering follows.

Here are all the guarantees I can find about the underlying byte representation of POD types in all three published standards.  I don't *think* the memory model changes anything here.

C++11 [basic.type]p2:
  For any object (other than a base-class subobject) of trivially copyable type T, whether or not the object holds a valid value of type T, the underlying bytes making up the object can be copied into an array of char or unsigned char. If the content of the array of char or unsigned char is copied back into the object, the object shall subsequently hold its original value.
C++03 [basic.type]p2:
  For any object (other than a base-class subobject) of POD type T, whether or not the object holds a valid value of type T, the underlying bytes making up the object can be copied into an array of char or unsigned char. If the content of the array of char or unsigned char is copied back into the object, the object shall subsequently hold its original value.
C++98 [basic.type]p2:
  For any complete POD object type T, whether or not the object holds a valid value of type T, the underlying bytes making up the object can be copied into an array of char or unsigned char. If the content of the array of char or unsigned char is copied back into the object, the object shall subsequently hold its original value.

C++11 [basic.type]p3:
  For any trivially copyable type T, if two pointers to T point to distinct T objects obj1 and obj2, where neither obj1 nor obj2 is a base-class subobject, if the underlying bytes making up obj1 are copied into obj2, obj2 shall subsequently hold the same value as obj1.
C++03 [basic.type]p3:
  For any POD type T, if two pointers to T point to distinct T objects obj1 and obj2, where neither obj1 nor obj2 is a base-class subobject, if the value of obj1 is copied into obj2, using the memcpy library function, obj2 shall subsequently hold the same value as obj1.
C++98 [basic.type]p3:
 For any POD type T, if two pointers to T point to distinct T objects obj1 and obj2, if the value of obj1 is copied into obj2, using the memcpy library function, obj2 shall subsequently hold the same value as obj1.

Note that while C++98 extended these guarantees to all objects, both were limited to most-derived objects by C++03, a restriction which persists into C++11.

I feel that this is clearly just a corrected oversight in the specification, but even an implementation that wished to pedantically hew to the C++98 rules would only need to avoid allocating objects in the tail-padding of types that were POD in C++98.  Since the generic ABI avoids this for the broader set of types that were POD in C++03, we're fully in compliance.

That said, tail-allocating more objects involves a potential time/space trade-off.  It may be undefined behavior to use memcpy to read or write to a trivially-copyable base-class subobject, but it's perfectly legal to copy them with a constructor or assignment operator.  Those operations generally compile to memcpy, but if the type can have objects allocated in its tail padding, that memcpy frequently has to be restricted to the data size of the type instead of its full size, which generally makes for a less efficient memcpy.  So it can be a performance win to disallow tail-allocation for a type if it's likely to be copied a lot and rarely if ever used as a base-class subobject.

4.  Proposal

Here is my proposed patch:
