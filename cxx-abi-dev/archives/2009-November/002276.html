That's my recollection of how EDG did it too, in the sense that I think
there were fields in the IL for COMDAT group, and a COMDAT-capable
back-end could thus emit them in the right group.

For G++, I believe that there was no support for actual COMDAT groups at
the time this got implemented, and so we fell back to weak/linkonce as
the closest equivalent.  In other words, I think this is was a
quasi-known bug in the G++ implementation.  The decision to make now,
then, is whether to fix G++, or change the ABI to permit the G++
implementation.
