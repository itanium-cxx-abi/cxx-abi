&gt;<i> As I recall, the ABI was intended to allow the various [cd]tor variants to

</I>&gt;<i> latter: it's a bit vague, but it seems to require that any vague linkage
</I>&gt;<i> [cd]tors be emitted as needed, each in their own COMDAT group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But if the two constructor variants are alternate entry points to the same
</I>&gt;<i> function, they can't go in different groups.  One could be implemented as a
</I>&gt;<i> jump to a different symbol in the other group, but that breaks if the linker
</I>&gt;<i> chooses a definition of the other group which doesn't define this symbol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone remember how this was supposed to work?  It seems like the only
</I>&gt;<i> way to deal with it is to add a new COMDAT group, put all the variants in
</I>&gt;<i> there, and accept that if you're linking objects from multiple compilers you
</I>&gt;<i> may end up with dead code in the output.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're currently looking at changing G++ to only emit one version of
</I>&gt;<i> [cd]tors when they'll be identical (i.e. when the class has no virtual
</I>&gt;<i> bases), and in the non-COMDAT case making one symbol an alias to the other.
</I>&gt;<i> This special case is not as problematic for the COMDAT case either, as one
</I>&gt;<i> function can just jump to the ABI-defined symbol for the other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only situation in which this could be a problem would be if one
</I>&gt;<i> compiler decided to make C1 jump to C2 and another compiler made C2 jump to
</I>&gt;<i> C1, and we choose one of each and end up with an infinite loop.  So I'd like
</I>&gt;<i> to specify which one will be the real function if a compiler decides to do
</I>&gt;<i> this.  I don't have a strong preference; the base variant is conceptually a
</I>&gt;<i> subroutine of the complete variant, but the complete variant is going to be
</I>&gt;<i> more commonly used.
</I>
Making the base be the &quot;real&quot; function seems more natural to me, particularly
as if there is a non-trivial difference, the base would be real anyway.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Adding an extra branch in the COMDAT case does have a performance impact,
</I>&gt;<i> so I'd like to do the redirection on the caller side.  Since the two
</I>&gt;<i> functions must be identical, I don't think there should be any problem
</I>&gt;<i> calling a different variant than specified by the ABI; does anyone disagree?
</I>
I don't see any execution problem, but the change would adversely affect the
debugging experience and programmers would see themselves calling the base
constructor rather than the outer constructor.  Whether that effect is worth
worrying about is a separate issue.
