Subject: C++ ABI: Titling the document
Message-ID: <1047523472.2453.360.camel@doubledemon.codesourcery.com>

The "C++ ABI for Itanium (Draft)" (as the document title reads) has
actually gone much further than that:

(1) It's probably no longer appropriate to call it a Draft.  Even 
    though it ain't perfect, it's pretty good.

(2) It's not really for Itanium any more.  It's certainly for all IA64
    chips, and it's really much more general than that.  There are only
    a few platform-specific bits.

So, I think we should drop the "Draft" and "Itanium" from the title.  

Any objections?

Subject: Copyright/license for the ABI?
Message-ID: <1047525980.2453.403.camel@doubledemon.codesourcery.com>

Someone's finally asked: who the heck has the copyright on the C++ ABI,
and what's restrictions (if any) are on other people using it?

Unfortunately, at this point, I don't think we really know all the
people/organizations who contributed to the ABI.  I'm pretty sure that
all of:

  CodeSourcery
  Compaq
  EDG
  HP
  Intel
  Red Hat
  SGI

participated, plus some individuals like Martin von Loewis.

So, I expect that technically all of those contributors (or their
assignees) share in the copyright.

I think that everyone fully expected that the document would be freely
available to everyone with basically no restrictions.

If so, perhaps we should put a notice on the document indicating that it
is in the public domain.

Are there any objections to that?

I assumed Itanium is used the name of the chip family, not the name of
a specific chip.  You could use "IPF", or spell it out as "Itanium Processor
Family".

The key point is that the same ABI is being used on ARM, x86, SPARC,
etc.

Mark:  Public Domain designation seems a good solution for a specification
(such as the IA64 ABI) where the main value is based on its wide adoption by
the developer community.

Thanks for hosting and the upkeep of the document,

Sassan.

I don't have a problem with a name change, but it seems like the ABI needs some 
kind of name other than just "The C++ ABI".  That seems too generic.  Even 
though it is being used elsewhere, it was developed for IA64, so I would find 
the continued use of that name acceptable.  Continuing to use that name has the 
advantange that people have been referring to it in that way for quite some time 
and a name change would somewhat invalidate existing documentation, etc. that 
refers to the old name.

In that case, I think we should honor Intel's request to call that architecture
"Itanium", not "IA64", which would mean to just drop "Draft" at this time.

Martin

I've added an "acknowledgements" section to mention the contributing
partners.  If there are organizations I've omitted,please let me know.

I have not yet added any sort of copyright notice (like an indication
that the document is in the public domain); I will wait a while longer
to see if there are any other comments on that topic.

I've also removed the word "Draft" from the title, since everyone seemed
comfortable with that change, but left the word "Itanium".

Is there a Creative Commons license that would meet
our needs?

There are lots of licenses that might be fine, including the OPL, GFDL,
etc.  The key problem is that we never got any sort of copyright
assignment on the part of the contributing parties -- so I don't think
we can easily make changes.  I don't think we even know who all the
contributing parties *are*.
