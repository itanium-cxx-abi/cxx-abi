A constant adjustment is not sufficient if you're converting to a virtual
base.
  Of course, the va_list option can still be presented.

  Another item for the list:

  Variadic virtual functions with covariant return types are currently
  problematic: it's not possible in general to generate an adjustor thunk
  for them, because it's not possible in general to forward a (non-tail)
  varargs call. Similar problems exist for the conversion to function
  pointer in a non-capturing varargs lambda.

  We can fix this by changing the calling convention for varargs non-static
  member functions so that they are passed a va_list object directly (that
  is, effectively put the va_start / va_end into the caller, and convert a
  va_start in the callee into a va_copy from the va_list argument). Then
  forwarding the varargs become trivial.

  (It seems preferable to apply this change to all non-static member
  functions, not just virtual functions, so that we don't need to emit two
  quite different codepaths for a call through a pointer to member.)

        Another item for the Itanium C++ ABI version 2 list:

        The ABI currently specifies that the initial guard variable load is
        an acquire load (3.3.2, &quot;An implementation supporting thread-safety
        on multiprocessor systems must also guarantee that references to
        the initialized object do not occur before the load of the
        initialization flag. On Itanium, this can be done by using a
        ld1.acq operation to load the flag.&quot;).

        This is inefficient on systems where an acquire load requires a
        fence. Using an algorithm due to Mike Burrows (described in the
        appendix of
        <A HREF="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2660.htm">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2660.htm</A>)
        the same interface can be implemented starting with a relaxed load,
        where the acquire operation is performed only the first time each
        thread hits the initialization.

        Hi,

        There are a few things in the current ABI which are known to be
        suboptimal, but we cannot change because doing so would introduce
        an ABI break. However, vendors sometimes get an opportunity to
        break their ABI (or are defining a new ABI), and for some vendors,
        this is a very common occurrence. To this end, I think it would be
        valuable for the ABI document to describe what we might want to put
        in a 'Version 2' of the ABI; that is, a set of changes that we
        recommend be made whenever a vendor has a chance to introduce an
        ABI break.

        (Or perhaps this should be viewed from the opposite perspective: we
        could make improvements to the ABI, with an annex listing changes
        that old platforms must make for compatibility.)

        Would there be support for this idea?


        In off-line discussion with John McCall, we came up with the
        following list of potential changes that might be made (sorry if I
        forgot any):

        &#160;* Make constructors and destructors return 'this' instead of
        returning 'void', in order to allow callers to avoid a reload in
        common cases and to allow more tail calls.
        &#160;* Simplify case 2b in non-POD class layout.
        &#160;* Make virtual functions that are defined as 'inline' not be key
        functions
        &#160;* Fix the bug that -1 is both the null pointer-to-data-member
        value and also a valid value of a pointer-to-data-member (could use
        SIZE_MIN instead)
        &#160;* Relax the definition of POD used in the ABI, in order to allow
        more class types to be passed in registers

        Are there any other things that it would make sense to change in a
        version 2 of the ABI?


        Also, would there be any support for documenting common deviations
        from the ABI that platform vendors might want to consider when
        specifying their own ABIs? In addition to some of the above, this
        would also include:

        &#160;* Representation of pointers-to-member-functions (in particular,
        the current representation assumes that the lowest bit of a
        function pointer is unused, which isn't true in general)
        &#160;* Representation of guard variables (some platforms use the native
        word size rather than forcing this to be 64 bits wide)

        Are there any others?


        Thanks!
