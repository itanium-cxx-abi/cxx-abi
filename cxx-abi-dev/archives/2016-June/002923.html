</I>
Hmm, good question.  The current G++ implementation scans dependent
expressions in a (member function of a class) template, and considers
those in both the signature and the return type of a non-template
member function (which is not part of its signature), leading to a
somewhat curious result for this example:

struct [[gnu::abi_tag (&quot;foo&quot;)]] A
{
  template &lt;class T&gt; static T f();
};

template &lt;class T&gt; struct B
{
  static decltype(A::f&lt;T&gt;()) g(decltype(A::f&lt;T&gt;()));
  static decltype(A::f&lt;T&gt;()) h();
};

int main()
{
  B&lt;int&gt;::g(0); // _ZN1BIiE1gEi -- the tag does not appear in the mangled name
  B&lt;int&gt;::h();  // _ZN1BIiE1hB3fooEv
}

Here G++ sees that A (and thus tag &quot;foo&quot;) appears in the signature of
B&lt;T&gt;::g, so it doesn't tag B&lt;T&gt;::g, even though the dependent
expression isn't actually part of the eventual mangling of B&lt;int&gt;::g
because for non-template member functions we mangle the instantiated
type rather than the temploid type.  The tag doesn't appear in the
signature of B&lt;T&gt;::h, so h gets tagged.

</I>
Templates have tags.

&gt;<i> I assume ABI tags can apply to unions as well.  (The standard's definition
</I>&gt;<i> of &quot;compound type&quot; distinguishes classes and unions.)
</I>
Of course, unions are classes.  There are separate bullets for them in
that paragraph, but the union bullet says that unions are classes.

&gt;<i> It's probably worth spelling out that tags do not apply to enumerators.
</I>
OK.

&gt;<i> Are ABI tags mangled in the &lt;prefix&gt;, or just on the entity &lt;name&gt;?
</I>
They are mangled as part of the name of the entity, whenever that name appears.

&gt;<i> What
</I>&gt;<i> happens if the same tag is applied to multiple places in the lexical
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchy, e.g. to both a class and one of its member functions?
</I>
Then it appears multiple times.

&gt;<i> I guess an inline friend function definition doesn't implicitly use the tags
</I>&gt;<i> of its defining class, but presumably has them anyway because of their
</I>&gt;<i> presence in the function signature.
</I>
Right.

&gt;<i> Can you clarify which things in the Clang description are no longer correct?
</I>
These lines:

&quot;If a function is used as a local scope for another name, and is part
of another function as local scope, it doesn&#8217;t have any required tags.
If a function is used as a local scope for a guard variable name, it
doesn&#8217;t have any required tags.&quot;

&gt;<i> I assume that a type used in the name of a conversion function should be
</I>&gt;<i> mangled with its ABI tag.
</I>
Yes, any time the name of the type appears, the tags appear as well.

&gt;<i> Also, I don't see anything in your proposed
</I>&gt;<i> wording that talks about not mangling ABI tags on an entity that appear in
</I>&gt;<i> its type.
</I>
&quot;that are not otherwise represented in the mangling&quot; was supposed to
cover that, but as we see with my example above it should really talk
about the type or signature rather than the mangling.
