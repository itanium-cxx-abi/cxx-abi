<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> (Note that even though the __cxa_guard functions are extern &quot;C&quot; you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can still observe their types; take their addresses.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But that is not relevant for the ABI, is it?
</I>
Well, the ABI has this little API part. :-)  The &lt;cxxabi.h&gt; header
is documented and required.  You can use it in low-level
applications -- one good example would be if you're writing a C++
interpreter that wants to interact correctly with compiled C++
object files.  (This was CenterLine's ObjectCenter product.)

All of the other functions have portable types; why not this one?

&gt;<i> In what way would you have to change g++? I.e. on what system does it
</I>&gt;<i> support a type long long which has not exactly 8 bytes?
</I>
Well, the runtime is broken, as Richard Henderson pointed out; we use
&quot;mode((DI))&quot; which needn't be 64 bits.  There's certainly nothing to
keep someone from making a GCC port where &quot;long long&quot; isn't 64 bits;
I don't know whether there already is such a thing in the FSF tree or
not.

&gt;<i> I claim that g++ conforms to the ABI, as both the ABI and g++ are, in
</I>&gt;<i> this very moment.
</I>
But if that's true, then it's harmless to make the ABI say &quot;long long&quot;
to match.

The point is that the G++ front end explicitly uses &quot;long long&quot; -- not
&quot;64-bit type&quot; -- when constructing a guard variable.

There are two cases:

1) Those things are always the same, in which case we may as well say
   &quot;long long&quot; in the ABI so that things match up and we have a
   well-defined type for the function, and so that a new GCC port
   doesn't accidentally stray from the ABI, or;

2) Those things are not always the same, in which case something needs
   to change, and G++'s widespread deployment would argue for the ABI
   changing.
