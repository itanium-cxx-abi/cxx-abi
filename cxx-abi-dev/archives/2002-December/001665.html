That is the right answer, of course.  But it needs to be at least
64 bits.  Your original message seemed to be suggesting that less
might be OK, and the consensus in the original discussion was that
a simple, efficient mutex implementation probably needs 64.

&gt;<i> There are two cases:

</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;long long&quot; in the ABI so that things match up and we have a

</I>&gt;<i>   doesn't accidentally stray from the ABI, or;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Those things are not always the same, in which case something needs
</I>&gt;<i>   to change, and G++'s widespread deployment would argue for the ABI
</I>&gt;<i>   changing.
</I>
As Jason points out, what we really should worry about is a future
situation where something larger is required.  It seems to me that
defining it as an opaque type with size at least 64 bits in the ABI
is the right thing to do.  If g++ implements that with long long, it
should be OK if the standard requires 64-bit long long.
