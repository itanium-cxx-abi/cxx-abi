Subject: Language-specific data area format
Message-ID: <8CA2B8D6-E835-11D5-B0E3-0030657CE6E6@cup.hp.com>

Gang,


Someone at HP recently pointed out to me that there is no documentation of 
the language-specific data area at all in the current C++ ABI 
documentation hosted by CodeSourcery. I guess this was lost when we 
switched from "my" document to the HTML format.

So I attached the relevant section from the original EH document (I hope 
this will go through the mailing list). Unfortunately, I'm no longer 
working on the C++ EH often enough to validate from memory if the overview 
given there is still accurate, or if it's completely off-base. I suspect 
it's still largely valid, but the type-info representation, at the very 
least, probably needs revision.

Once this has been validated, I propose that we do the following:

- In the interim, place a link to this PDF file in place of the Level III 
"Suggested Implementation" paragraph 3.2 "Data Structures" which currently 
reads "To be supplied"

- In the long-term, convert the original text from its current format to 
HTML + GIF.


Regards,
Christophe de Dinechin

Yep.  The process lost momentum before the document was finished.

Indeed.  Our implementation basically follows the specification in your
document, though we use a variety of encodings (pc-relative,
section-relative, indirect, etc.) for the pointers between different
sections depending on the capabilities of the target, and so have added
fields to tell the personality routine about the encoding.

One hole in your specification that we ran into while implementing this was
how to represent the three different cases of:

1) call must not throw
2) throw from call should just keep unwinding
3) throw from call should run cleanups and keep unwinding

We decided to implement these as

1) lsda present, no call site entry
2) omit lsda if possible, or call site entry with no landing pad
3) landing pad, no action record

There was some feeling that a missing call site entry should indicate case
2, and that an entry with no landing pad case 1, but the above seemed to
match your document better.

Agreed.

Since nobody has objected, I have done as you suggest.
