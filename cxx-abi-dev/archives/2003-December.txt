Subject: 3.4 Demangler API, for types

Does the following mean we need to demangle types from type_info?

3.4 Demangler API   (__cxa_demangle)

o mangled-name is a pointer to a null-terminated array of characters.
It may be either an external name, i.e.  with a "_Z" prefix, or an
internal NTBS mangling, e.g.  of a type for type_info.

So "i" would be "int".

So this would be the BNF starting with: 5.1.5 Type encodings  ??

It seems that g++'s c++filt has logic to handle "i" as a parm and "i" in
a source file:

$ /usr/local/bin/c++filt < stuff
i i i i
l l ll
j
$ /usr/local/bin/c++filt i
int

Is the logic as simple as looking for leading _Z for the file case?

I'm not sure what c++filt behaves differently when reading "i" from a
file than on the command-line.

The demangler should demangle "i" to "int".

If the name doesn't start with "_Z", the demangler should try to
demangle the name as a "<type>", as you say.

I assume that "i" in a file is more apt to not be a symbol.
And files usually have external symbols with _Z?

Yes if on the command line, g++'s c++filt "(C++ demangler), version 3.2".
This version also doesn't handle "foo" on the command line, it prints:
$ /usr/local/bin/c++filt foo
float

Ok, I've made that change and for my c++filt, I have the similar diffs
on file vs. command line.
Though I do demangle "foo" as "foo" and not "float".
