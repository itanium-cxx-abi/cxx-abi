Since we use type_infos in the exception handling mechanism, it seems
reasonable to allow user code (specifically terminate_handlers) to be able
to get at this information.  This is already possible by examining the
contents of __cxa_get_globals, but that requires knowing the layout of
__cxa_eh_globals.  It seems to me that it makes sense to provide another
entry point to get just this information.  ABI patch and implementation
attached.

It seems reasonable to me to add this even now, since it's a pure
extension; people can add it to their runtimes at their leisure.  Thoughts?

Jason

Wouldn't it be then useful to give access to the exception object
also?

Regards,
Martin

I don't think so; I think try/catch are a better way to get a handle on the
exception object.  When I started writing a verbose terminate handler,
originally I was trying to hand the object pointer from the EH structures
off to the dynamic cast machinery by hand to get an exception*, until I
realized that I could just write

  try { throw; }
  catch (exception& e) { ... }
  catch (...) { }

which is both simpler and portable.

Clever.

I think your ABI extension is a good one, and I don't see any reason
not to include it.  If there aren't any objections in the next week,
I'll include it.  (I've put a sticky on my virtual calendar to
remind me.)

I guess we should make this optional, in the same sense as the
priority stuff is optional -- if you implement this, this is what
you should do, but if you're trying to write code portable across
ABI implementations, you should not depend on this being present.

Do you agree?

Seems reasonable.

I incorporated this patch, with the additional sentences:

  This routine is optional; a conforming ABI implementation need not
  provide it.  However, if it is provided, it shall have the behavior
  specified here.
