<PRE>How are the following two statements reconciled?

   1.3
   _Unwind_Resume should not be used to implement rethrowing. To the
   unwinding runtime, the catch code that rethrows was a handler, and
   the previous unwinding session was terminated before entering it.
   Rethrowing is implemented by calling _Unwind_RaiseException again
   with the same exception object. 

   2.5.4
   [__cxa_rethrow] then returns to the handler that called it, which
   must call __cxa_end_catch(), perform any necessary cleanup, and
   finally call _Unwind_Resume() to continue unwinding. 

Given how _Unwind_Resume is intended to operate wrt Phase1 and Phase2
of _Unwind_RaiseException -- i.e. properly identifing the Phase1
indicated catch handler, I think 2.5.4 is incorrect.

There appears to be an intended equivalence between _Unwind_Resume and
a direct branch (via the HP described [RESX] operator).  But you'd get
incorrect results if you implemented __cxa_rethrow with [RESX] for the
following test case:

	inline void foo() throw(B)
	{
	  try {
	    throw A;
	  } catch (A) {
	    throw;
	  }
	}
	int main()
	{
	  try {
	    foo();
	  } catch(...) {
	  }
	}

since the [RESX] would resolve to a direct branch to main's catch.
One needs to go back to the personality routine to discover that
there is an exception specification disallowing A.

To me it seems much more logical for __cxa_rethrow to do all the work
coordinating with __cxa_end_catch and to call _Unwind_RaiseException
again itself, as this would reduce the amount of generated code
required.  A minor technical point is how the rethrow interacts with
the surrounding __cxa_end_catch cleanup region -- does the compiler
arrange for the action chain for __cxa_rethrow to omit the cleanup,
or does __cxa_end_catch need to be prepared to handle this case? 
Either works, but unlike some of the other implementation differences
that can be hidden in the personality routine, this one can't so 
there would have to be agreement.

Have I missed something?
