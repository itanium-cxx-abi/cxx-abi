<PRE>In the current ABI document, there&#8217;s this little bit:
  
  Names of objects nested in namespaces or classes are identified
  as a delimited sequence of names identifying the enclosing scopes.
  In addition, when naming a class member function, CV-qualifiers
  and ref-qualifiers may be prefixed to the compound name, encoding
  the this attributes. Note that if member function CV-qualifiers or a
  ref-qualifier are required, the delimited form must be used even if
  the remainder of the name is a single substitution.

That last sentence is really weird, because the &quot;delimited form&quot; is
&lt;nested-name&gt;, and the non-delimited form is either
&lt;unscoped-name&gt; or &lt;unscoped-template-name&gt; &lt;template-args&gt;,
and &lt;unscoped-name&gt; can never just be a single substitution.

The only way I can make any sense from this is to read it as saying
that, if you&#8217;re mangling a member function template specialization,
and you already have a substitution for the member function
template, but the member function template specialization has
CV- or ref-qualifiers, you still need to use &lt;nested-name&gt; in order
to mangle the CV- or ref-qualifiers.  As opposed to just using
&lt;unscoped-template-name&gt; &lt;template-args&gt;.

More concretely, suppose I have:
  struct A {
    template &lt;class T&gt; void foo() const;
  };
and I need to mangle a reference to A::foo&lt;int&gt;, and I&#8217;ve already
decided that the template A::foo is S2_.  The sentence *might* be
saying that I can&#8217;t just mangle this as &#8220;S2_IiE&quot;, I have to mangle it
as &#8220;NKS2_IiEE&#8221;.

But that implies that if the method weren&#8217;t const then I *could* mangle
this as &#8220;S2_IiE&#8221;, and that&#8217;s very strange, because I&#8217;ve always interpreted
the general rule for substitutions as only allowing substitution if the
unsubstituted entity would naturally end up in that production.  A member
entity can&#8217;t normally be mangled as an unscoped name, so you don&#8217;t
consider that production, so you don&#8217;t have the opportunity to apply
the substitution for the template-name there.

Abstractly, it&#8217;s not an unreasonable idea to use that mangling, since it
does produce strictly shorter names, so I&#8217;m not completely opposed.
But it does seem like a special-case rule that needs to be written explicitly.
Also, neither Clang nor GCC actually does it this way, and I&#8217;m curious
if anyone does.

(Even if we adopted this rule, there&#8217;s still no reason for the qualifiers
exception to it, since you can recover those qualifiers from the original
place that gave rise to the substitution.)

Here&#8217;s a concrete example using a member class template:

struct A {
  template &lt;unsigned I&gt; class B {};
};
template &lt;class T&gt; void bar(T t, A::B&lt;0&gt; x = {}, A::B&lt;1&gt; y = {}) {}
int main() { bar(0); }

A compiler which always mangles member templates as nested-names
will mangle this as:
  _Z3barIiEvT_N1A1BILj0EEENS2_ILj1EEE

A compiler which uses the unscoped mangling when a substitution
already exists will mangle this as:
  _Z3barIiEvT_N1A1BILj0EEES2_ILj1EE

Unless somebody finds a compiler that actually does the latter, I think
this is just a specification bug and we&#8217;ve always meant the former.
I&#8217;m in the middle of rewriting the prose in this section anyway; if nobody
objects in the next week or so, I&#8217;ll just fix this while I&#8217;m there.

John.
