<PRE>I prefer option 1, with the caveat that the runtimes understand that the stack is no
longer reasonable.  At this point, the application is going down for sure, so I don't
think
that's unreasonable.  It also allows the most flexibility to the runtime.  I am *not*
a fan
of having the unwinder call abort at this point, or to having undefined behaviour.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The current wording doesn't match the C++ standard:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If the unwinder encounters an unexpected error during phase 2,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the unwind runtime may have modified the stack, e.g. popped
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; frames from it, or landing pad code may have caused stack corruption.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; As a result, the unwind library probably could not find a return address,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and the caller of _Unwind_RaiseException could make no assumptions about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the state of its stack. Rather than attempt to return, therefore, the unwind
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; library should use the exception_cleanup entry in the exception,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and then call abort().
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What C++ mandates in that case is calling terminate(), not abort(), and that's a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decision that only the C++ runtime can make (it may be different for other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; languages).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What's more, the justification doesn't apply very well on IA-64. There is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only one return address for _RaiseException, and it is not on the stack
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but in a local register (br0). Therefore, _RaiseException has very good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chances of being able to return to the C++ runtime, and from there, we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; move only downwards in the calls tack (terminate() which typically calls
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; abort() itself).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So the paragraph above should indicate that we return _URC_FATAL_PHASE2_ERROR.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I was about ready to do this, when I got worried.  I know we
</I>&gt;<i> talked about this last week, and agreed as above, but I'd like to get
</I>&gt;<i> confirmation from more people than were present that we're not opening
</I>&gt;<i> an implementation can of worms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As Christophe points out, the objection that a return address might be
</I>&gt;<i> hard to find is at least overstated.  But the bigger problem is that
</I>&gt;<i> the caller of _Unwind_RaiseException must assume a garbaged stack, and
</I>&gt;<i> likely has garbage in its registers, including GP and an unknown
</I>&gt;<i> stacked register state, which might make it difficult to find
</I>&gt;<i> terminate() to call it.  So the problem isn't really difficulty
</I>&gt;<i> for the unwind runtime, but for its caller.  This call (to
</I>&gt;<i> _Unwind_RaiseException) will happen in many places in compiled code, so
</I>&gt;<i> I would think that if we're not careful, we could place some nasty, and
</I>&gt;<i> not very useful, constraints on compilers.  Who has thought about the
</I>&gt;<i> implications of this, and what do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are several potential specifications we can make:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  1) Unwinder returns _URC_FATAL_PHASE2_ERROR.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      a) Nothing further specified.
</I>&gt;<i>      b) Require that caller call terminate() with no further help.
</I>&gt;<i>      c) Require that the unwinder also return valid GP for caller
</I>&gt;<i>         (and perhaps other registers).  (Remember that we've been
</I>&gt;<i>         modifying the context during phase 2 unwinding, so this
</I>&gt;<i>         probably requires extra work in the unwinder.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  2) Unwinder calls abort().
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  3) Unwinder may do either (1) or (2).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  4) Unwinder behavior is completely undefined.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Biases, anyone?
