<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; A) a user program derives from abi::pointer_type_info and then attempts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to use objects of that class within the type_info system?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; B) parts of the program other than those in libcxa.so attempt to use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the implentation defined entry points?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am concerned about both.
</I>
Why is that a concern? If a user inherits from abi::pointer_type_info,
what undesirable effects could come out of that?

I was more concerned about having the compiler-provided code in a
static library which then gets integrated into somebody's shared
library (as gcc's libgcc.a gets integrated into every shared library,
likewise libCrun.a and libCstd.a of Sun CC).

&gt;<i> That solution implies a statement that the non-Standard-defined parts
</I>&gt;<i> of the hierarchy are not available to users.  Fine with me, but someone
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to make the field names in the hierarchy normative, which has no
</I>&gt;<i> point unless they expected them to be used outside the target
</I>&gt;<i> runtime.
</I>
Used in the sense of being accessed - yes, why not? However, I would
not expect users ever to create typeinfo objects.

&gt;<i> It is a traditional part of the SysV ABI that libc is _always_ a DSO.
</I>&gt;<i> I presume that we're extending that assumption to libcxa, though I
</I>&gt;<i> guess we'd better say so.
</I>
If that is the intent then yes - we should say that.

&gt;<i> I personally believe that anyone who links the system libraries into
</I>&gt;<i> their program is tying his program to a particular implementation, and
</I>&gt;<i> had better use only pieces from that implementation (if it's supported
</I>&gt;<i> at all, which I wouldn't, and SGI traditionally hasn't).  So, ... no
</I>&gt;<i> problem.
</I>
The problem is that there is a difference between system libraries and
the C++ runtime library - those typically come with the C++ compiler,
not (necessarily) with the system.

Regards,
Martin
