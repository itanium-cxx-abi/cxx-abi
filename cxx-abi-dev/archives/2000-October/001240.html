<PRE>
Turnout was low today.  Following are the results of our discussion.
I will be out of town next week -- the following week, I will put
together an issue list (aka agenda) and explicitly call for email
discussion around the end of the week in lieu of a meeting.  Now would
be a good time for everyone to go through the documents carefully and
identify any residual issues that require discussion/clarification or
just plain better description.

We will meet to clear up any residual questions in four weeks.

There are several subjects that may produce discussion -- please
reference one issue per message and change the subject line...

Jim


----------------
RTTI portability
----------------

The issue here, raised originally by Martin, I will open as A-30.
Implementations will generally need additional virtual functions
associated with the type_info hierarchy to implement such functionality
as dynamic cast.  Gcc for instance has functions __is_function_p,
__do_catch, __pointer_catch, ...

A program that is built from pieces from different compilers, where the
pieces come from different implementations of the hierarchy, will see
different structures, at least in the vtables, if we allow this extra
material to be arbitrary, creating a problem if such programs actually
make use of parts of the hierarchy.

We worked out the following possible solution:

  First, observe that the vtables for the typeinfo derived classes will
  be emitted where the key function (the virtual destructor, as
  defined) is defined.  We require this to be in the implementation's
  runtime library libcxa.so, so there is exactly one implementation of
  them on any given target system.

  We allow the implementation to define a collection of pseudo-virtual
  functions to be associated with each class derived from std::type_info:

	class __cxa_aux_typeinfo {
	  ... (*__is_function_p) (...);
	  ...
	};

  The implementation will create one instance of this class for each of
  the classes derived from std::type_info, and we will specify a
  mangled name for it.

  We add the following to the ABI definition of std::type_info:

	class std::type_info {
	  ...
	  protected:
	    __cxa_aux_typeinfo *__aux;
	    type_info (void) { /* set up __aux */ };
	};

  Construction of one of the std::type_info derivatives can either call
  the constructor or use the mangled name to initialize the __aux
  member.

  Use of __aux is reserved to the runtime implementation.

Now an implementation can add an arbitrary set of functions to
__cxa_aux_typeinfo, specialized to the derived class like a virtual
function, without changing the external interface (to the user) of
the hierarchy.

Does this meet people's needs?


---------------------------
Value parameter destruction
---------------------------

We decided that it is possible for a program to tell that value
parameter destruction does not occur in the correct order if it is done
in the callee, so I will change 3.1.1 to specify that it is done by the
caller.


---------------------------------------
Exception handler __cxa_throw_type_info
---------------------------------------

Making this type be a pair (type_info and destructor pointers) makes it
necessary that a thrower or __cxa_throw construct one so that the
exception object can point to it.  This can't be done on the stack,
since it's about to be unwound, and doing it on the heap when the
exception might be out-of-memory doesn't seem ideal.

We propose that instead, we replace the __cxa_throw_type_info pointer
in the exception object header by separate std::type_info and
destructor pointers, and pass them as two parameters to __cxa_throw.

We also noticed that, if the thrown object is an array, the destructor
passed will need to be a fabricated one which loops over the array
elements.  The alternative, to store the array bounds explicitly in the
exception object, seems to be a lot of overhead for a very rare case.


--------------
long long type
--------------

I have used &quot;long long&quot; in several places in the document; as it is
non-standard, I will replace it by __int64_t or __uint64_t (unless
someone has a better idea).


-----
UTF-8
-----

We didn't discuss this, but I'm prepared to insert a comment.  Would
someone who cares about it care to suggest wording and placement?


-------------------------------
Thread-safe data initialization
-------------------------------

We didn't discuss this -- we still haven't heard from Christophe.  This
is important, as I don't think anyone is delighted with what is
currently in the document.  What should we do?
