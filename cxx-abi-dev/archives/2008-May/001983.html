Thanks -- that's a nice write-up!


&gt;<i> Although, thinking about it some more, there might be a way. There  
</I>&gt;<i> could be essentially two kinds of __cxa_exception. One looks like  
</I>&gt;<i> the old one, with an added reference count. The other holds a  
</I>&gt;<i> pointer to the first kind instead. All exception_ptrs refer to the  
</I>&gt;<i> primary __cxa_exception, but on rethrow they allocate a secondary  
</I>&gt;<i> that also refers to the first.
</I>

That's an interesting idea.


&gt;<i> This might work. But *only* if all modules link to the support  
</I>&gt;<i> library dynamically, of course. If any of them links statically, it  
</I>&gt;<i> would keep the old implementation, which would wreak havoc.
</I>

What sort of failure modes would we expect.  Could the  
&quot;__cxa_exception by reference&quot; be made to look like std::bad_exception  
to an old runtime support library?

&gt;<i> I'll look into implementing that.
</I>

FWIW, I've contacted Peter Dimov about this issue, and he seems  
agreeable to prohibit rethrowing an exception captured with  
current_exception() using &quot;throw;&quot; (until it has been rethrown with  
rethrow_exception, at which point it can be caught/rethrown the usual  
way).

Note that we're still dealing with a working paper, not a frozen draft  
or standard.  So if this kind of tricky issues arise, there may be  
wiggle room left to fix the spec.  (But not for long.)
