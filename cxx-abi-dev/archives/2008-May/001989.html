-----------------------------

With the integration of N2179 &quot;Exception Propagation&quot;
(<A HREF="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2179.html">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2179.html</A>)
into the C++0x working paper, the C++ ABI described at
<A HREF="http://www.codesourcery.com/cxx-abi/abi-eh.html">http://www.codesourcery.com/cxx-abi/abi-eh.html</A> has unfortunately become
insufficient. It describes a model where exceptions are bound to a single
thread and cannot be copied, whereas exception propagation was introduced
for the specific purpose of transferring exceptions between threads.

In order to allow implementation of exception propagation, I propose the
following changes to the ABI. These changes have been successfully 
implemented
in the G++ compiler.

This version of the draft takes binary compatibility very seriously. The 
goal is
to have only a single restriction on backward compatibility, which is 
that all
code must run with an updated version of the support library. Code linking
statically against the old library must be relinked. It is possible to 
link code
compiled with a new compiler to an old support library, unless 
exception_ptr is
used. (In that case, there would be unresolved symbols from exception_ptr.)


The Level I ABI remains unchanged.


Level II: C++ ABI

The current C++ ABI is structured like this: the exception data lies in 
a single
block of memory, starting with C++-specific information (the __cxa_exception
object), then the general unwind header (the unwindHeader field of the
__cxa_exception object), and finally the actual C++ exception object. 
Neither
the __cxa_exception object nor the unwind header can be used concurrently in
more than one thread. Therefore, these parts of the data must be copied 
in order
to implement N2179.
The previous proposal advertised an approach that separated the 
exception object
from the __cxa_exception object. There were serious concerns regarding 
the ABI-
breaking nature of this change.

This proposal instead follows this approach: there is one primary exception
object, which has the same layout as in the old ABI, with a reference count
prepended. There can be multiple dependent exception objects referring 
to the
primary, which duplicate the necessary information. The primary and 
dependent
exception objects use different exception class identifiers in order to 
have the
support library be able to distinguish them. A throw-expression with an 
argument
allocates a primary exception object. Calling std::rethrow_exception() 
with an
exception_ptr allocates a dependent exception object.

The primary exception object continues to use the exception identifier 
&quot;C++\0&quot;.
The dependent exception object uses &quot;C++\x01&quot;.

2.2.1 C++ Exception Objects

The __cxa_exception is prepended a reference count:

    struct __cxa_exception {
        std::size_t        referenceCount;
        std::type_info *   exceptionType;
        void (*exceptionDestructor) (void *):

        unexpected_handler unexpectedHandler;
        terminate_handler  terminateHandler;
        __cxa_exception *  nextException;
        int                handlerCount;

        int                handlerSwitchValue;
        const char *       actionRecord;
        const char *       languageSpecificData;
        void *             catchTemp;
        void *             adjustedPtr;

        _Unwind_Exception  unwindHeader;
    };

The referenceCount field counts the dependent exceptions and exception_ptrs
referring to this primary exception.

In addition, a new struct __cxa_dependent_exception is introduced:

    struct __cxa_dependent_exception {
        void *             primaryException;

        unexpected_handler unexpectedHandler;
        terminate_handler  terminateHandler;
        __cxa_exception *  nextException;
        int                handlerCount;

        int                handlerSwitchValue;
        const char *       actionRecord;
        const char *       languageSpecificData;
        void *             catchTemp;
        void *             adjustedPtr;

        _Unwind_Exception  unwindHeader;
    };

The primaryException field of a dependent exception shall always point at a
primary exception (just after the __cxa_exception, as per convention).

The nextException field of the structures can point either at a 
__cxa_exception
or a __cxa_dependent_exception. However, it shall point to a dependent 
exception
such that the offset to the unwindHeader field is the same. In other 
words, the
field (and caughtExceptions of __cxa_eh_globals) shall be used like this:

    __cxa_eh_globals *globals = __cxa_get_globals();
    __cxa_exception *eh = globals-&gt;caughtExceptions;
    __cxa_dependent_exception *deh = 0;
    if (eh-&gt;unwindHeader.exception_class == dependent_exception_class) {
        deh = reinterpret_cast&lt;__cxa_dependent_exception*&gt;(eh + 1) - 1;
        eh = static_cast&lt;__cxa_exception*&gt;(deh-&gt;primaryException) - 1;
    }

Note that, since the tail of primary and dependent exception are 
identical, it
is not actually necessary to cast to access these fields, as long as the 
offset
to the unwindHeader is the same. For example, you can access
the nextException field of globals-&gt;caughtException without casting, and it
will give the correct result whether you're dealing with a primary or a
dependent exception.

2.4.1 Overview of Throw Processing

Throw processing remains the same, for primary throw expressions. For
rethrow_exception(), the process obviously differs, and is described below.

2.4.2 Allocating the Exception Object

__cxa_allocate_exception remains the same. __cxa_free_exception remains the
same.

To create dependent exceptions, two new functions are introduced.

    __cxa_dependent_exception*
    __cxa_allocate_dependent_exception() throw();

This function shall allocate a __cxa_dependent_exception and return a 
pointer
to it. (Really to the object, not past its end.) The function shall 
otherwise
behave as __cxa_allocate_exception.

    void __cxa_free_dependent_exception(__cxa_dependent_exception*) throw();

This function shall free a __cxa_dependent_exception. It does not affect the
reference count of the primary exception.

2.4.3 Throwing the Exception Object

The first argument passed to __cxa_throw shall refer to a primary exception,
not a dependent one. __cxa_throw shall set the reference count of the 
primary
to 1. (It works under the assumption that the __cxa_exception was newly
allocated and its reference count was 0.)

2.5.3 Exception Handlers

__cxa_begin_catch has unchanged behaviour.

__cxa_end_catch has modified behaviour:
* It locates the most recently caught exception and decrements its handler
count.
* If the handler count goes to zero, it removes the exception from the
caughtExceptions stack.
* If the handler count goes down to zero, and the exception was not 
re-thrown
by throw, it locates the primary exception (which may be the same as the one
it's handling) and decrements its reference count. If that reference count
goes to zero, the function destroys the exception. In any case, if the 
current
exception is a dependent exception, it destroys that.

With std::current_exception() available, it would be possible to add an
ABI-specific extension to exception_ptr with equivalent functionality as
__cxa_current_exception_type(). For example:

    exception_ptr ep = current_exception();
    std::type_info *ti = ep.__cxa_exception_type();

2.5.4 Rethrowing Exceptions

The semantics of __cxa_rethrow are unchanged. std::rethrow_exception is
described separately.

On a side note, __cxa_rethrow may have to update the terminate and 
unexpected
handler. Clarification from the Core Working Group on this issue would be
appreciated.

2.5.5 Finishing and Destroying the Exception

__cxa_end_catch must observe the restrictions as detailed in 2.5.3.

2.7 Exception Propagation

Since exception_ptr provides a mechanism to influence the lifetime of
exceptions, I consider it part of this machinery and will describe it in 
short
here.

exception_ptr is a smart pointer. Its only member is a pointer to a primary
exception. It uses this exception's reference count, incrementing upon 
taking
ownership and decrementing and potentially destroying upon releasing it.

std::current_exception() examines the current exception. If there is 
none, or
it is foreign, it returns null. If the current exception is dependent, it
obtains the primary exception and returns a pointer to that. If the current
exception is primary, it is returned directly.
Because the function does not allocate memory, it will never return a 
pointer
to a std::bad_alloc object.

std::rethrow_exception() shall call __cxa_allocate_dependent_exception() and
make it reference the primary exception pointed to by the exception_ptr. It
shall increment the reference count of the primary exception. It then 
behaves
like __cxa_throw: it stores the unexpected and terminate handlers, sets the
exception_class field (to the dependent class name, of course), 
increments the
uncaught_exception flag and calls _Unwind_RaiseException.

std::copy_exception() can be implemented like the standard says, or it can
call __cxa_allocate_exception() and initialize the exception object, 
then return
a pointer to that.
