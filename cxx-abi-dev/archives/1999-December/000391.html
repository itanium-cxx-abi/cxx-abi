<PRE>&gt;<i> I believe I did; I just implemented this in GNU libc.  All of atexit,
</I>&gt;<i> on_exit, and __cxa_atexit share the same list of exit functions.  When
</I>&gt;<i> __cxa_finalize is called from a DSO, only __cxa_atexit functions are
</I>&gt;<i> called.  When exit is called (on exit from the main executable), all
</I>&gt;<i> of the functions are called, in reverse order of registration.  The
</I>&gt;<i> main executable therefore does not call __cxa_finalize at all.  Works
</I>&gt;<i> like a charm, as far as I can tell.
</I>
I believe the issue here is the support of non-integrated C and C++
libraries. You've been modifying the C library, which is the right
approach if possible. In some cases, it might not be feasible, and I
believe Jim's proposal is to offer a fall-back for this case, with
degraded functionality. I don't know whether this actually works,
though.

If you don't have integrated C and C++ libraries, you'll still have
the need for cxa_atexit, but you can't put that into the C libraries'
atexit. Fortunately, that is not required by the international
standards - all that is required is interworking with std::atexit. So
you have std::atexit invoke __cxa_atexit, and get the right
interleaving. Of course, that won't cover atexit calls made from C
objects, but that is not feasible, anyway.

Then, of course, the question is how to run the __cxa_atexit list at
the end of the program. To do so, the proposal is to put a
__cxa_finalize call into the .fini section.

Unfortunately, it seems that this approach breaks the case when you do
integrate the C and C++ libraries; in this case, the extra call gets
in the way of extern &quot;C&quot; atexit processing, which must be placed into
the runtime system very cautiously.

My proposal: it is left unspecified by the ABI how exactly the
__cxa_atexit list is invoked - whoever provides the implementation of
__cxa_atexit and __cxa_finalize is also responsible for having the
finalizers called at the right point in time (i.e. as a result of
std::exit invocation).

Regards,
Martin
