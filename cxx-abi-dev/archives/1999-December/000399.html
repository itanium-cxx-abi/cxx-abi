<PRE>This is an interesting discussion, but I think the objectives
characterization has gotten a little confused, so let me an attempt to
draw it a little differently.

In the elf context assumed by the base IA-64 ABI, I expect that a C++
program will typically be running with the C run-time library libc.so,
the C++ runtime library libC.so, likely other system DSOs, and its own
components.

In this context, achieving an integrated solution could be accomplished
in a couple of ways.  The obvious one is to replace the routines
atexit, on_exit, and exit in the C run-time library with routines that
are cognizant of the C++ __cxa_atexit and __cxa_finalize facilities.
a less obvious method, but still generally usable, would be to insert
C++-specific versions of them in the C++ runtime library, and depend on
preemption to achieve the replacement.  This works as long as libC.so
precedes libc.so in the library list.

There are other possible non-integrated solutions, but given the
assumption of the underlying IA-64 ABI, and the fact that the second
solution above can work without changing the underlying C run-time
library, it doesn't seem necessary to consider them.

What is an issue, however, is that the application could in theory be
linked on a different system than the one where it ultimately runs,
and therefore presumably on a different system than that which built
the run-time library DSOs.  It is that interface which we need to pin
down, namely (a) what routines (with what interfaces and semantics)
must be present in libC.so/libc.so, and (b) what sequences of calls
the libraries may assume the program will make.

We appear to be agreed on the presence of __cxa_atexit and
__cxa_finalize in libC.so, on the registration of C++ destructors
and C atexit cleanup with __cxa_atexit, and on the use of
__cxa_finalize for destructor execution upon early unloading.
The open questions are (1) whether (or how) on_exit registration can
be integrated, and (2) how the final cleanup is invoked.

The original proposal adopted ignored (1) out of ignorance, and
answered (2) by specifying a call to __cxa_finalize(NULL).  If (1) is
addressed by calling __cxa_atexit for on_exit with a parameter, and
passing an additional exit code parameter to __cxa_finalize (and thence
to all the finalization actions it invokes), this works, i.e. on_exit
works as currently defined by Sun and is properly integrated into the
finalization order.  But that assumes that the exit code is available
for passing to __cxa_finalize, which may imply calling it from exit if
it's not available to a .fini_array routine (which was what the
original proposal specified).

Mark points out that it works to just assume that exit does the
call to __cxa_finalize, or performs the equivalent processing,
eliminating the need for the explicit __cxa_finalize call in
.fini_array.  This is slightly simpler in that it doesn't require
generation of the .fini_array entry, and the library implementation
can coordinate features like on_exit without exposing the interfaces
necessary to implement them.  It also probably preserves more
faithfully the traditional semantics that atexit routines are executed
before the main program .fini_array, although doing __cxa_finalize
first in the latter should produce the same effect.

Note that we can't just not choose -- one approach requires the builder
of the main executable to insert a .fini_array entry, while the other
doesn't -- unless we want to require the run-time to handle either,
which doesn't seem useful.

My current preference is to proceed with Mark's proposal, requiring
that exit handle the __cxa_atexit -registered calls (but _not_
requiring that anyone explicitly register __cxa_finalize or anything
else to accomplish that).  Upon re-reading all the mail, this seems
quite workable.  In any case, I'll re-open the issue and we can discuss
it next time.
