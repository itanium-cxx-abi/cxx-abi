<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Martin von Loewis &lt;<A HREF="http://sourcerytools.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/cxx-abi-dev">loewis at informatik.hu-berlin.de</A>&gt; writes:
</I>
 &gt; A) External names for identifiers containing unicode letters; e.g.

 &gt;    namespace newmath{
 &gt;       const long double \u03A0 = 3.14159265358979;
 &gt;    }

 &gt;    This is also an issue for C99, so it may be that the base ABI has a
 &gt;    specification; we'd have to follow that at least for extern &quot;C&quot;
 &gt;    names. If not, I propose that such names are encoded in UTF-8.

UTF-8 is inappropriate for mangled names, as it uses values &gt; 127 to encode
non-ASCII characters.

GNU Java encodes names in UTF-8 internally.  For the mangled name, if there
are non-ASCII characters, it adds a 'U' to the beginning and encodes each
such UCS-2 character as _%04x.  See gcc/java/mangle.c.

This assumes that all interesting characters fall within the Basic
Multilingual Plane (the low 16 bits); that is a valid assumption for us,
since all the extended characters valid for use in C++ identifiers are part
of the BMP.

 &gt; B) Object file representation of narrow and wide string literals
 &gt;    containing such characters, eg.

 &gt;       wchar_t MvL[]=L&quot;Martin von L\u00F6wis&quot;;

 &gt;    First, what is sizeof(wchar_t) in the base ABI? I'll assume 4 for
 &gt;    the moment. Then, the question comes down to: What is the execution
 &gt;    character set, and the wide execution character set? 2.2/3 says
 &gt;    they are implementation-defined, so I guess we must define
 &gt;    them. Typically, people expect this to be a run-time setting (which
 &gt;    is a reasonable assumption), but it kind-of breaks for string
 &gt;    literals.

 &gt;    Proposal: The wide execution character set is UCS-4. The
 &gt;    execution-character-set is &quot;as-is&quot;, i.e. bytes from the source
 &gt;    character set are copied unmodified to the object
 &gt;    file. Universal-character-names appearing in narrow (ie. char)
 &gt;    strings are not portable in this ABI (the other alternatives would
 &gt;    be to say they are Latin-1, or encoded as UTF-8, I guess).

I have been told that it is inappropriate to assume that wchar_t is always
UCS-4; a suggestion was to convert from UCS-4 to the host locale character
set using iconv(), and then if we're in a wide string, convert to wchar_t
with mbtowc().  This makes sense to me, though of course it requires iconv
to know about UCS-4.
