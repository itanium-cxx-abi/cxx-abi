just like you've got for the before() description.

</I>When you're testing for equality, all the cv qualifiers must match. Think about
how `typeid (A *) == random_type_info' would behave. Assume random_type_info
doesn't involve incomplete types.

If A is complete, we'll do a pointer comparison on the type_info objects themselves.
If A is incomplete, we just need to compare the top level NTBS's.

It's in catch matching that we have to follow the pointer chain, and then it is
permissible for the cv qualifiers to differ (but only such that it is a
qualification conversion). In those cases we have to follow the chain regardless
of the completeness of the final non-pointer type.

BTW. I've realised there is another scheme which would allow type_info equality
to be pointer equality in all cases. The scheme we have at the moment essentially
forces operator== to involve a virtual function call. If we have separate objects
for the result of typeid to that used by dynamic_cast and catch matching then this
problem goes away. The cost is an extra vtable entry and the inability to provide
`augmented' type information via typeid (which we don't do at the moment anyway).
I know it's a little late in the day, but I've only just realized that we had lost
this address equivalence property. If there's interest I can write that up in
short order.
