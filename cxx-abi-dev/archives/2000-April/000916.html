 &gt; Issue 1)

 &gt; It is permissible in a pointer to member of X, for X to be an incomplete
 &gt; type [8.3.3]/2. This means that we need more that a single incomplete
 &gt; flag.

Yup.

 &gt; The presence of such a ptr to member, will mean that it, and all
 &gt; pointers to it will have their incomplete flag set, but its target
 &gt; might not be an incomplete chain. In implementing G++'s rtti runtime I
 &gt; found the following three flags useful, (this is with
 &gt; __pointer_to_member_type_info derived from __pointer_type_info)

I don't think it's proper to make that derivation; a pointer to member is
not a pointer.  This matters to the EH type matching code, which does a
dynamic_cast to _pti*.

 &gt; Issue 2)

 &gt; The algorithm for collation order of type_infos, cannot simply compare
 &gt; addresses for non-pointer types, and complete pointer types.  Using
 &gt; string collation only when one of the types is a pointer with the
 &gt; incomplete_mask set. There are two difficulties. Firstly, we might be
 &gt; comparing a non-pointer type_info with a pointer type_info. We need to
 &gt; determine this and DTRT WRT the incomplete flag of the pointer
 &gt; type_info. to do that will require dynamic_cast or typeid'ing the
 &gt; type_infos. Secondly, assume we are just comparing pointer type_info's.
 &gt; We have two pointers to complete, Aptr and Bptr, and a third pointer to
 &gt; incomplete, Cptr.

 &gt; 1) Aptr.before (Bptr) can just compare addresses.
 &gt; 2) Bptr.before (Cptr) will compare names.
 &gt; 3) Cptr.before (Aptr) will compare names.

 &gt; There is nothing maintaining the consistency of the results of these
 &gt; three tests -- result 1 is uncorrelated with results 2 &amp; 3....
 &gt; Therefore type_info::before must be implemented as string compare on the
 &gt; type's names. We lose any advantage of commonizing the type_infos.

What if we put the incomplete flag in type_info and decide that all
incomplete type_infos are &quot;before&quot; all the complete type_infos?

 &gt; Issue 3)

 &gt; 17.4.4.4 prevents an implementation adding member functions to one
 &gt; of the std classes, except in particular circumstance. About the only
 &gt; leeway given is whether a particular non-virtual function is inline or
 &gt; not. So I presume we're not permitted to add virtual member functions
 &gt; to std::type_info (18.5.1). The rules given in 17.4.4.4 specifying what
 &gt; member functions can be added look like applications of the as-if rule,
 &gt; but there must be something deeper going on, as if that was all, it
 &gt; wouldn't be mentioned. I'm not sure how a conforming program could tell
 &gt; whether additional functions had been added.

17.4.4.4 specifies that you can add overloads to member functions in
certain ways that *can* be detected by a conforming program.  There are no
restrictions on adding member functions with other names, by the as-if rule.

 &gt; Issue 4)

 &gt; 5.2.8 talks about typeid returning something derived from type_info,
 &gt; but the footnote mentioning extended_type_info implies to me that
 &gt; typeid always returns objects of the same type. Again, I'm not sure
 &gt; how a conforming program could tell.

I disagree with your interpretation.

Jason
