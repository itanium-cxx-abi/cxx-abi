 &gt;&gt; The presence of such a ptr to member, will mean that it, and all
 &gt;&gt; pointers to it will have their incomplete flag set, but its target
 &gt;&gt; might not be an incomplete chain. In implementing G++'s rtti runtime I
 &gt;&gt; found the following three flags useful, (this is with
 &gt;&gt; __pointer_to_member_type_info derived from __pointer_type_info)

 &gt; I don't think it's proper to make that derivation; a pointer to member is
 &gt; not a pointer.  This matters to the EH type matching code, which does a
 &gt; dynamic_cast to _pti*.

It was suggested in the meeting today that both _pti and _ptmti be derived
from a common base instead; this makes sense to me.

 &gt;&gt; Issue 2)

 &gt;&gt; The algorithm for collation order of type_infos, cannot simply compare
 &gt;&gt; addresses for non-pointer types, and complete pointer types.  Using
 &gt;&gt; string collation only when one of the types is a pointer with the
 &gt;&gt; incomplete_mask set. There are two difficulties. Firstly, we might be
 &gt;&gt; comparing a non-pointer type_info with a pointer type_info. We need to
 &gt;&gt; determine this and DTRT WRT the incomplete flag of the pointer
 &gt;&gt; type_info. to do that will require dynamic_cast or typeid'ing the
 &gt;&gt; type_infos. Secondly, assume we are just comparing pointer type_info's.
 &gt;&gt; We have two pointers to complete, Aptr and Bptr, and a third pointer to
 &gt;&gt; incomplete, Cptr.

 &gt;&gt; 1) Aptr.before (Bptr) can just compare addresses.
 &gt;&gt; 2) Bptr.before (Cptr) will compare names.
 &gt;&gt; 3) Cptr.before (Aptr) will compare names.

 &gt;&gt; There is nothing maintaining the consistency of the results of these
 &gt;&gt; three tests -- result 1 is uncorrelated with results 2 &amp; 3....
 &gt;&gt; Therefore type_info::before must be implemented as string compare on the
 &gt;&gt; type's names. We lose any advantage of commonizing the type_infos.

 &gt; What if we put the incomplete flag in type_info and decide that all
 &gt; incomplete type_infos are &quot;before&quot; all the complete type_infos?

Never mind; this won't work, of course.  In the meeting we liked your
proposal B, and deferred a decision on A.  Thinking about it now, I'd
prefer to just go with B; splitting up the type_infos seems unnecessary.
