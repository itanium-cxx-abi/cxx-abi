</I>I presume you're refering to g++'s runtime. The only dynamic_casts of
this kind are in g++'s old-abi catch matcher. The new-abi doesn't need
any, using virtual functions. Or were you thinking of somewhere else?
Where the old-abi has dynamic casts, the new abi code has.
   catch_type-&gt;do_catch (...)
&amp;
   thrown_type-&gt;is_pointer_p ()

</I>I do not think this is necessary, but I've no strong feeling about it.
Having a common base adds complexity (bad), but not having it constrains
implementations to use vfuncs rather than dynamic_cast (possibly bad).

&gt;<i> 17.4.4.4 specifies that you can add overloads to member functions in
</I>&gt;<i> certain ways that *can* be detected by a conforming program.  There are no
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions on adding member functions with other names, by the as-if rule.
</I>Doh! you're right a conforming program could tell by (attempting to)
take the function's address.

&gt;<i> Never mind; this won't work, of course.  In the meeting we liked your
</I>&gt;<i> proposal B, and deferred a decision on A.  Thinking about it now, I'd
</I>&gt;<i> prefer to just go with B; splitting up the type_infos seems unnecessary.
</I>I have come to this conclusion too.
