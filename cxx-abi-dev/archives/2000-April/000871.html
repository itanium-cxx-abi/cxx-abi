That sentance _must_ be changed. In the language of the standard an 'A *' is
a complete type, regardless of A. That sentance, and its effect on the equality
operator was causing all my confusion. The subsequent paragraph on type_info::before
is also incorrect. I suggest the following wording for those paragraphs,

 For any particular complete type symbol, which is not a direct or indirect pointer
 to an incomplete type, only one std::type_info structure is accessible via the external
 name defined by this ABI, after linking and loading. Therefore, the equality and
 inequality operators can be implemented as address comparisons when operating on
 those type_info objects: two type_info structures describe the same type if and
 only if they are the same structure (at the same address). In the case of pointer
 types, directly or indirectly pointing to incomplete class types, a more complex
 comparison is required, described below with the RTTI layout of pointer types. 

 In a flat address space (such as that of the IA-64 architecture), the before()
 member is also easily written in terms of an address comparison, when neither
 type_info object is a direct or indirect pointer to an incomplete class type.

 The only additional piece of information that is required is the NTBS that
 encodes the name. The type_info structure itself can hold a pointer into a
 read-only segment that contains the text bytes. 

In addition, the __pointer_type_info docs need amending -- it's not at all clear
that the abi::__pointer_type_info themselves must be local static. I suggest

 When the abi::__pointer_type_info is for a direct or indirect pointer to an incomplete
 class type, the incomplete target type flag is set. In addition, it is prevented
 from resolving to the equivalent abi::__pointer_type_info which directly or indirectly
 points to the complete class type, possibly by making it a local static object.
 If the target type is the incomplete class type itself, a dummy class RTTI is
 generated for the incomplete type that also is prevented from resolving to the
 final complete class RTTI (because the latter need not exist).

The paragraph descriping pointer equality seems to describe a rather long winded
algorithm -- and it's incomplete as it doesn't say the cv quals must be compared.
Why not just compare the NTBS's of the pointer types themselves? I suggest

 When abi::__pointer_type_info objects are compared for equality, if either has the
 incomplete flag set the NTBS of the std::type_info bases must be compared. When
 neither incomplete flag is set, the addresses of the abi::__pointer_type_info objects
 can be compared as with the other types. The implementation of before() behaves
 similarly.
