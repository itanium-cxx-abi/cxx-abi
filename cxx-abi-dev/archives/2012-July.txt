All:

I just want to make sure I'm referring to the latest when I look at an
issue.  Is that web version still the latest?

Thanks!

Matt

Unfortunately, nobody has been keeping up with the task of editing
that document.  So the canonical information is (1) whatever's in that
document plus (2) the last year-and-a-half of discussion on this list.

In the interests of not just idly complaining, if any of the current
maintainers are still reading this list, I'd be happy* to take over the
editing duties.  It's not much work, but... well, it's not getting done,
and that's becoming a problem.

John.

I've pinged some folks that might be able to unstick this document.
I'll follow-up with what I find.

Folks,

I've not forgotten about this thread and I'm still working on it.  I
expect to have something to share soon.

Thanks,

Thank you!

One thing I've had on my mind...  I don't know the base format the
document is kept in, but would it be worth translating to something
that could generate printable documentation easier?  Once it is
updated, perhaps translating it to Markdown?

Matt
