<PRE>&gt;<i>From: John McCall &lt;<A HREF="http://sourcerytools.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/cxx-abi-dev">rjmccall at apple.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>To me, it sounds like aCC warning about the metaprogramming
</I>&gt;<i>use case, you got a bug about it, and you fixed it, but that you never
</I>&gt;<i>intended to support actually doing this at runtime.
</I>
I don't think so.  ;-)

It was supported with that test case back in 1996 but with the scary form
of the warning.  Supported in that the test did exactly what the warnings
said.

I assume this functionality came from cfront or was built into the Taligent
compiler.

(I'm not sure how this was ported to the EDG compiler if we didn't have
a functional test for it?  Or it's too hard to find.  :-)

The test case that had the warning had nothing to do with it (since
a decade later) but with placement delete.

&gt;<i>But its your decision, or I should say HPs.  If you feel comfortable
</I>&gt;<i>saying that you do not currently support passing non-POD types through
</I>&gt;<i>varargs, and that you consider it undefined behavior,
</I>
Undefined by the Standard but implemented with HP's definition of a bitwise
copy.

&gt;<i>then I think the best thing for the ABI is to say that vendors who
</I>&gt;<i>choose to support non-POD varargs must follow Jason's proposal.
</I>
&gt;<i>Otherwise, we&#146;ll have to be much more weaselly about it. :)
</I>John.

I don't have any objections but Soumitra might.

It would be nice to point to HP's aC++ and mention another way of doing it
but it's not ideal.  :-)
