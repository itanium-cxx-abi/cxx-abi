Yes, I think that was indeed the original purpose of the flags.

&gt;<i> Now, these might both seem small optimizations, but they're the two
</I>&gt;<i> most evident uses (to me) of the flags. It would be rash to remove such
</I>&gt;<i> information from si_class_type_info.

I'll second Nathan on this.
