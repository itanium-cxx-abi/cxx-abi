I believe that that is true.

&gt;<i> If so, do you know why the committee made this decision?
</I>
It grew out of discussions of what it meant for two template declarations
to refer to the same entity.  A number of people felt it was important
not to outlaw examples like the ones we have been discussing.  Not enough
people cared to defend the opposite situation.  Back then I was naive and
unexperienced ;-)  Oh, and I had no vote---don't shoot the messenger ;-)

&gt;<i> translation unit 1

Hmmm, I cannot make up my mind about that.  Even when I transpose that
to a real module system, I see such situations as a possibility.

&gt;<i> External functions are usually declared in header files, so in
</I>&gt;<i> general the programmer isn't going to know which f is being called and the
</I>&gt;<i> inclusion of another header is going to change the behaviour of the
</I>&gt;<i> program.  Paragraph 5 of 14.5.5.1 seems to me to be there solely to make
</I>&gt;<i> this situation worse.  What am I missing?
</I>
I also find it to have little technical benefit.

It does guarantee us a job for life though &lt;grin&gt;.
