Yes, but gcc is one of those compilers that will need to change its
string implementation.  My company is a heavy user of a non-standard
string simply because the gcc standard string is reference counting.

&gt;<i> &gt; The C++0x library now requires an O(1) size operator.

&gt;<i> Not yet :-) That will be voted on in a few hours (at the time of

</I>
And that vote passed.  The requirement is now in the working draft.

&gt;<i> &gt; This will cause an ABI breaking change in something like half
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the std::list implementations, one of which is gcc.
</I>

</I>
&gt;<i> Which types were you thinking of?
</I>
This conclusion came from discussions with Howard Hinnant, and he
was not specific.

&gt;<i> &gt; Howard Hinnant informs me that Apple plans to not have any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; binary compatibility between the two versions of the standard,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; except that standard exceptions are binary compatible and hence
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can cross from one version to another.
</I>
&gt;<i> And certainly every vendor is at liberty to change their library
</I>&gt;<i> signatures.  However, some vendors also plan to avoid breaking
</I>&gt;<i> library compatibility if they can and with the current standard
</I>&gt;<i> revision, that is entirely possible (because they already have
</I>&gt;<i> an O(1) std::list::size() and a non-reference-counted std::string).
</I>
&gt;<i> Even those vendors that will have to break compatibility may
</I>&gt;<i> provide binary compatibility options with e.g. inline namespaces.
</I>
&gt;<i> In either case, I am not willing to foil such goals by changing
</I>&gt;<i> the underlying ABI.
</I>
First, let me note that I argued strongly in favor of taking some
position on binary compatiblity, but was unable to get the committee
to adopt a policy.  As a result, we have inconsistent expectations
on compatiblity.

Second, my concern is that we probably will not have effective
binary compatibility anyway, and not taking advantage of that
incompatibility has real performance costs.

I would dearly like an experiment in compatibility between a fully
baked C++0x implementation and a C++03 implementation.  I do not
see that experiment happening any time soon.  On the other hand,
we probably can defer binary compatibility decisions until later.
