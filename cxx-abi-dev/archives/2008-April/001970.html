Well, that's embarassing; clearly my memory is pathetic.

So, yes, we agreed to use TC1 PODs, and thus pointers-to-members are in. 
  In that case, yes, I think we have to say how they are laid out -- but 
I think we already do.

For data members, we say that a pointer to data member is &quot;represented 
as a ptrdiff_t.&quot;

And for pointers to function members; we say that they have &quot;the size, 
data size, and alignment of a class containing these two members&quot;, after 
saying what members they are.  I think we could probably make that more 
explicit by saying that they layout is as for the following class:

   struct pointer_to_member {
     void (*ptr)();
     ptrdiff_t adj;
   };

That would eliminate ambiguities.  But, I think that's just an editorial 
change.  (Anyone object to that change?  Or think it's a good idea?)

Thoughts?
