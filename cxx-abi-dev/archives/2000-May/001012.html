<PRE>As you might gather from the flurry of messages, I've finished integrating
the last meeting, along with much of the email, into the HTML pages on
the web (PDF tomorrow, perhaps).  If possible take a quick look.  I'll be
in Monday PM and might integrate further _minor_ fixes then.  After that,
getting the main site updated might be tricky before I return on 19 June.

There appear to be a couple of questions that ought to be resolved by
email soon, rather than by a meeting in a month if possible:

1) Mark's question about whether it's really worth attempting to avoid
   duplicate vcall offsets for multiple instances of a function with the
   same signature in different bases.

2) Mark's question about identifying which subobjects need secondary
   vtable pointers in the VTT.

3) Alex's suggestion that we allow the ::std:: abbreviation outside
   the N...E nested name delimiters.

4) Alex's suggested alternate (partial) mangling grammar.  (Note that
   this is intended as further clarification, not as a change in the
   agreed definition, except for (3) above.)

In the absence of concensus via email, I think we ought to assume that
the current definitions hold, but I can live with any resolutions that
achieve concensus.  (In the case of (4), you can assume that there will
be further grammar modifications -- I didn't attempt that just because
I didn't want to further destabilize things just before taking off.  I
hope the parties working on this understand the intent well enough now
to be able to tell the difference between the intent and the grammar.)

Again, quick fixes could go in Monday, others will wait until mid-June.

Til then,
Jim
