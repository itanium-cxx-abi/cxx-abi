No, I don't think this is quite what we have been discussing.

This vtable layout problem is unlike the layout decisions we are used to making.
Usually, the problem is to lay out a B vtable such that the layout is
consistent among vtables that &quot;look like a B&quot;.  That is, we select function
and vbase offsets so they are invariant among the &quot;B in D&quot; vtables for all
(applicable) D, where &quot;applicable&quot; simply means that D is derived from B.

In this case, though, the free variable is different.  The requirement is to
select an (available) location for an adjust-to-D offset, such
that the B in D vtables for all (applicable) B can use the same offset.
For nonvirtual inheritance,
&quot;applicable&quot; means &quot;where D overrides one or more functions introduced or
overridden in B, and B and D do not share a vtable&quot;.

Your statement of the rule would have us adding a slot to D's vtable,
but in fact that is what we never do, because a D vtable never needs
an &quot;adjust to D&quot; slot; instead we add slots to (some of) the secondary
vtables in a D object.

&quot;Available&quot; is also an interesting word, it means &quot;for each of those
B base classes, and for each direct base X of D such that X derives
from B, the B in X vtable either doesn't use this slot, or uses it for an
adjust-to-Y adjustment that is no longer needed because all of Y's virtual
functions that required offsets are overridden somewhere in the D hierarchy&quot;.

Now, you could simplify this rule, at the expense of wasting some vtable space,
by not detecting those reusable adjust-to-Y slots, but I don't believe
there is any simplification that amounts to allocating a slot in D's table.

And, as I described in an earlier note, the mechanism is totally different
when B is a virtual base:  In that case, I believe we have to allocate a
separate slot for each function in B, otherwise reconvergent (diamond)
inheritance can introduce conflicts.


All of which leads me to remark ...

This is an interesting problem and all, but I am not entirely
comfortable with the amount of invention it involves.
Standards activities usually try to avoid being so creative.
This work is on a promising path, but I believe we should represent
it as an &quot;experimental ABI&quot; until it is proven by an implementation.
