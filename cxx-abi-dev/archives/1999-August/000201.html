Re: vtable layout, sharing vtable offsets
I'm going to write the exam on this to see how well I
am understanding the issue.

If I understand it correctly, the proposal under consideration
is tied to the decision to replicate virtual function
entries in vtables.  It requires
replicating in the vtable for base class B all virtual functions
that are overridden in B; more replication that this implies will
be wasted since a function is always called through a vtable
of an introducing or overriding class.

When a non-pure virtual function X::f() is compiled it is possible to determine
whether it requires a secondary entry point.  It will require one
if that function may be virtually called (i.e., is the final overrider)
in any class in which f() appears in more than one vtable; this
needs to be decidable knowing only X.
A rule that works is: X::f() overrides one or more f()'s from base classes
of X, and either one or more of those base classes are
virtual or X fails to share its vptr with all instances of them.

[Though a virtual base may happen to share its vptr with X
in an object of complete type X, that relationship may fail to
hold in further derived classes, so we need to generate the
secondary entry point just in case.]
[&quot;Sharing a vptr&quot; is the condition under which no adjustment
is necessary; if the bases involved are all nonvirtual then
subsequent class derivation won't change this.]

Each vtable that requires a nonzero adjustment will have a
&quot;convert to X&quot; offset mixed in with its virtual base offsets.  It is
necessary that a &quot;convert to X&quot; appears in the same position in
each vtable that references X::f()'s secondary entry; it is desirable that
the &quot;convert to X&quot; also be unique in each vtable.

Assume that X has nonvirtual nonprimary bases Nx (x=1,2,...), and virtual
bases Vx, all of which have a virtual f().   Then vtables for Nx in X, or in any
class
derived from X that does not further override f(), will reference X::f()'s
secondary entry.   Vtables for Vx in X or any derived class where Vx does
not share a vptr with X, will also reference X::f()'s secondary entry; note
this will occur in a construction vtable even if the derived class does
further override f().

The question, then, is whether a position for the &quot;convert to X&quot; offset can be
chosen, knowing only X and its parentage, that can be used consistently
in all those vtables and that won't collide with a &quot;convert to Y&quot; position
chosen on account of some other hierarchy where Y::g() overrides an
Nx::g() or Vx::g().

If Y derives from X, we will be able to select a &quot;convert to Y&quot; position
that doesn't conflict, so we can restrict our attention to cases where X
and Y are unrelated.
Also, if the base involved is nonvirtual (Nx) then we are safe,
because no instance of Nx will be a subobject of both X and Y, so no
Nx vtable will require both &quot;convert to X&quot; and &quot;convert to Y&quot; offsets.

The remaining case is where X and Y are unrelated but both have
a virtual base Vx:

struct V1 { virtual void f();  virtual void g(); };
struct Other1 { virtual void ignore1(); }
struct X : Other1, virtual V1 { virtual void f(); }

struct Y : Other1, virtual V1 { virtual void g(); }

struct ZZ: X, Y {}

The vtable for N1 in ZZ does require both offsets.
The only way I see to accomplish this is to preallocate
an adjustment slot for each virtual function in V1.  That
is, X::f() uses the first slot position, and Y::g() the second,
based on the order that f() and g() are declared in V1.
This only needs to be done in hierarchies where V1 is virtual,
but the same offset has to be used for any Nx tables in X too.

Is this close?


Re: Concatenating vtables
I don't understand the comment that varying numbers of virtual
base offsets make it impossible to concatenate vtables and refer
to them via a single symbol.
The only code that refers by name to X's vtable and the vtables
of N1 in X etc. is X's constructor and destructor, and maybe some
derived classes that find they are able to reuse some pieces.
All that code is aware of X's declaration and can map out its tables.
What am I missing?
