</I>Disagree.
C::f needs a virtual thunk for A, no thunk for B1 no thunk for B2.
In C's vtable there will be a subvtable for B1 which contains a sub
vtable for A. There will be a secondary vtable for B2, which will
contain a sub vtable for the A base of B2. There is no A base inside
the B2 base in an object, but B2's vtable will need space allocating
as if there was one. Also it has to be set up correctly, so that if
we have a pointer to the B2 base in C, a call to f will correctly
adjust. (As B2 also defines an f, we don't have to convert the pointer
down to an A * before the virtual function call.)

&gt;<i> But it occurs to me that since the B2 vtable
</I>&gt;<i> already has a vcall slot for f, we can use the virtual thunk there, too,

</I>The current g++ implementation is wrong in this regard. I've
just fixed some stuff concerning nearly-empty virtual primary base
classes that g++ was getting wrong. Mark's looking at that patch
at the moment, and, if he doesn't find anything amiss, it'll go in
tomorrow.

This is what g++ currently thinks C's vtable should be
Vtable for C
C::_ZTV1C: 10 entries
0     0
4     0
8     0
12    &amp;_ZTI1C
16    C::_ZTv0_n12_N1C1fEv
20    -4
24    0			&lt;- vcall adjust from B2 to C claimed to be zero
28    -4
32    &amp;_ZTI1C
36    C::_ZTvn4_n12_N1C1fEv &lt;- const adjust of -4 then virt adjust 

here is what C's vtable should look like (and does with my patch)
Vtable for C
C::_ZTV1C: 10 entries
0     0
4     0
8     0
12    &amp;_ZTI1C
16    C::_ZTv0_n12_N1C1fEv
20    -4
24    -4		&lt;- vcall adjust from B2 to C is -4
28    -4
32    &amp;_ZTI1C
36    C::_ZTv0_n12_N1C1fEv &lt;- virtual adjust

I agree with your conclusion, but not with your intermediate step of
the B2 vtable in C being permitted to have a constant adjusting thunk.
