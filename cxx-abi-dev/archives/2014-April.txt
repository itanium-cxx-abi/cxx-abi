Subject: [cxx-abi-dev] Layout of overaligned empty base classes
Message-ID: <CAGL0aWdkwojJVGQ2isUvt+agaeHJXqu2aUXsKqT4uy+bv7TtSQ@mail.gmail.com>

2.4/II/3 says:

"If D is an empty proper base class: [...potentially misalign the D base
class...] Note that nvalign(D) is 1, so no update of align(C) is needed."

This is not true.

struct A {};
struct B : A { char c; };
struct alignas(4) D : A {};
struct C : B, D {};

This puts a D object at offset 1 within C, and gives C nvalign of 1, which
is obviously not right. Fortunately, GCC, Clang, and EDG all deviate from
the ABI and instead do the natural thing here (put it at offset zero if you
can, and otherwise allocate it like any other subobject). Looks like the
wording only needs a little massaging here to say the right thing.

Ping?  Any interest in adding __cxa_thread_atexit to the C++ ABI?
Would it help if I prepared a proposed change and sent it as a pull
request or something?

Okay, I?ve applied and pushed these changes.  Thanks!

Yes, preparing a proposal would be great.  Please send it here,
though, not as a push request to github.
