Subject: __cxa_exception vs __cxa_call_unexpected
Message-ID: <20010508224957.A26175@redhat.com>

The c++ exception structure contains 

  int handlerSwitchValue;
  const unsigned char *actionRecord;
  const unsigned char *languageSpecificData;
  void *catchTemp;

for use in communicating between the personality routine and
__cxa_call_unexpected.  In order to be able to interpret the
LSDA, one needs a copy of the associated GP.  I don't see any
place that this value may be cached.  The _Unwind_Context was
local to _Unwind_RaiseException, and so was destroyed when we
transfered control to the handler.

What are other folks doing?

Clearly, we have a problem, since Jim is no longer at SGI.  The SGI
web page will not let a non-SGI employee assume ownership.

We will move the list to our server, but I will need to get a list of
all the active participants, and SGI's majordomo isn't keen on this.

If you're on this list -- and would like to stay on it -- please send
me a message with your email-address, and I'll set up a new list with
those addresses.

Thanks!

By now, you should have received a message explaining that your
subscription to the C++ ABI mailing list has been transferred to the
new mailing list at `cxx-abi-dev at codesourcery.com'.

If you have *not* received that message -- but you do receive this one
-- please let me know.

Thank you,

Message-ID: <20010510143141G.mitchell@codesourcery.com>


Welcome to the new C++ ABI mailing list!

The list address is:

  cxx-abi-dev at codesourcery.com

You'll have to pardon the extra `dev' in the mailing list; it is there
for obscure technical reasons.  (In other words, because I'm not the
All-Knowing Master of Email.)

Thanks to Jim Dehnert and Andreas Jaeger, I have obtained the complete
subscribtion list for the old list, so everyone from the old list
should be on the new list.

You can manage your subscription by sending email to:

  cxx-abi-dev-request at codesourcery.com

You'll get help mail in reply explaining how to subscribe,
unsubscribe, etc.

You can also subscribe to the digest version -- although the low
recent traffic means this probably isn't too attractive.

The new mailing list also has an on-line web-archive.  (There's
nothing interesting there yet -- there's no archive there of old
postings.  If anyone has the old postings, in the form of a UNIX
mailbox, let me know.  I think I can arrange to manually get them into
the archive -- without reposting them to everyone again.)

The archive is reachable from the main page at:

  http://www.codesourcery.com/cxx-abi/

There's now a link a bit of the way down, under the heading of
"Mailing Lists".

Yours,
