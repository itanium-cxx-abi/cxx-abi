FYI, you are subscribed to the c++abi list, which is about to get livelier
again; SGI is organizing a new ABI discussion, and this seemed like the
appropriate place to mirror the discussion at Cygnus.

 Here's the general information for the list you've subscribed to,
 in case you don't already have it:

This list is being created for discussion of
C++ ABI issues.  The impetus is the impending
release of systems based on IA-64, but most
issues are more generic, and the group is not
restricted to participants with Intel NDA access
(and hence discussions should not explicitly
reference Intel NDA material).
