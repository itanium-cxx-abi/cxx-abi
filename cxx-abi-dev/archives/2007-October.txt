Subject: Apology re. spam
Message-ID: <4720BE2E.4070602@codesourcery.com>

I apologize for the spam that appeared on this list today.

All mail going to the list is run through a spam filter which, for
whatever reason, failed to catch this mail.  Because the list was
configured to allow subscribers to post without moderation, and because
the offending poster subscribed before posting, the messages did indeed
make it to the list.

We've now reconfigured the list to require that all messages be
moderated, and, of course, removed the spammer from the list.
