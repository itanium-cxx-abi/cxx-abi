That works for me.

Right, it's definitely still worth documenting the conventions for this function
for implementations that want to use it.

Okay.  But the init function doesn't return a T&amp;, right?  So we still need a
wrapper, and not only that, but a non-trivial wrapper that actually rederives
the address of the variable?  That seems unfortunate.

I would guess that the odds are that most translation units are only going
to define at most one single thread-local variable that needs dynamic
initialization.  Why don't we have the everything-in-the-TU init function return
a reference to the last thread_local variable it initializes?  That let you emit
at least one init function as an alias; for the rest you'll need stubs, but they
should be fairly small because they're in the defining translation unit.

&gt;&gt;<i> It looks like static data members of class templates fall out naturally here,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The init function symbol is an alias to the function that initializes all the thread_local variables defined in a translation unit.  For a variable with vague linkage, the alias should be weak.
</I>
Hmm.  Those of us not on ELF might need to go in a totally different
direction here.  I am not at all confident about making an alias to a
weak symbol, particularly when the referent is generally not semantically
equivalent.

John.
