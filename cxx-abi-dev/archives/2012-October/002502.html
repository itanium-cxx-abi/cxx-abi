But if type B has a member of type A, signatures that use B are not affected, leading to silent ABI incompatibilities.

I'm inclined to make the arguments to the attribute user-provided strings which will then be gathered together and attached to any symbol name that uses the class, or to the mangled name of the function, respectively.

Including tags from subobjects breaks in the presence of incomplete types.  It would also make it almost completely impossible to have a binary-stable C++ API.  I think this is a non-starter, unfortunately.

Having a way to tag individual methods for ABI compatibility breaks is an interesting idea, but I think you actually need a language extension here, because simply removing the old declaration and tagging the new one isn't good enough if binary compatibility requires you to actually emit a symbol for the old definition.  There may be relatively few non-inline symbols in the STL, but there are a fair number of explicit instantiations.  Unless you're planning to fake this with some *extremely* non-ODR-compliant definitions hidden inside the library.

John.
