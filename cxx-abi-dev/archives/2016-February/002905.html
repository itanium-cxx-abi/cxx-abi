Hmm.  I&#8217;m somewhat surprised by this, at least from Clang; maybe it&#8217;s applying union restrictions via some other route.

&gt;<i> If that is right, should the 3.1.1/1 words above be edited to read:

I agree that the intended semantics of the ABI here should not change and that we should modify the wording in the ABI to reflect the behavior we want.  Two points, though:

First, technically speaking, we need language cover for this.  Implementations are not allowed to introduce extra copies of types that aren&#8217;t trivially copyable.  (IIRC, the rule is narrower than &#8220;trivially copyable&#8221;, but I can&#8217;t seem to find the exact wording.)

Second, the wording change needs to be more precise: it should use well-defined terms from the standard, and it should cover the recursive cases.  We should introduce a new term to the glossary, maybe &#8220;non-trivially copyable for the purposes of calls&#8221;, and define it the way we want, probably something like:

  non-trivially copyable for the purposes of calls
    A type is considered to be non-trivially copyable for the purposes of calls if it is a class type and:
    - its destructor is non-trivial, or
    - all of its copy and move constructors are deleted, or
    - it has at least one copy or move constructor which is non-trivial for the purposes of calls.

  non-trivial for the purposes of calls
    A copy or move constructor is considered to be non-trivial for the purposes of calls if it is not deleted and:
    - it is user-provided or else
    - it is defaulted and either
      - the class has virtual functions or virtual bases or
      - the constructor chosen to initialize one of of subobjects is non-trivial for the purposes of calls.

I believe this is the currently-intended rule (albeit a rule that I haven&#8217;t yet standardized in the document).

John.
