<PRE>&gt;<i>From: John McCall &lt;<A HREF="http://sourcerytools.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/cxx-abi-dev">rjmccall at apple.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm saying that __cxa_end_catch is the code that destructs the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> full-expression, if you elide the copy construction.
</I>
&gt;<i>This conversation would be substantially easier if you looked
</I>&gt;<i>up terms like &quot;full-expression&quot; that you don't understand.
</I>
&gt;<i>Note that the actual exception object is not formally a temporary.
</I>
Thanks for the details.
My confusion was not in &quot;full-expression&quot; but thinking the exception operand
was a temporary.

&gt;<i>Regardless of whether copy elision occurs, __cxa_end_catch has
</I>&gt;<i>the potential to throw, because it has the responsibility to destroy the
</I>&gt;<i>actual exception object ('exn').
</I>&gt;<i>which, as I mentioned, is not a temporary.
</I>
And here I mistakenly thought the Standard didn't allow the throw because
this was a temporary.

&gt;<i>But only some calls to __cxa_end_catch occur during unwinding:  only if
</I>&gt;<i>you throw out of a catch clause.  If control falls out of a catch clause,
</I>&gt;<i>and the destructor for the caught exception object throws an
</I>&gt;<i>exception, that new exception just starts propagating.
</I>
That's the one I was confused about.

&gt;<i>in the catch for a 'void *', you know that __cxa_end_catch
</I>&gt;<i>will not throw, because that catch type cannot catch any objects
</I>&gt;<i>with destructors.
</I>John.

Ah, so at compile time, you could statically remove the landing pad on
__cxa_end_catch based on that.

I found out my problem.  The landing pad for __cxa_end_catch was set to
__cxa_end_catch.  ;-)
I.e. the call wasn't treated special and for that one, don't add that call.
