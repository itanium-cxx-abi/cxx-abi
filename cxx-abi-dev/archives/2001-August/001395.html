</I>
Hmm.  Perhaps I misremember; I will try to find out.  It is true that
it would be no less efficient (and probably more efficient) to do
comparisions of the NTBS instead of the type_info.  I guess Richard
confused me because the original bit on the GCC lists was about changing
from pointer-comparison to strcmp for typeinfo names, and that is an
efficiency hit.

</I>&gt;<i>

One down.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Startup cost happens once per program, except for any excess memory

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> graphical definitely qualifies) this isn't *too* important, and there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are techniques (caching, prelinking) that can get around the problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And yet it seems to be a significant problem for a significant number of
</I>&gt;<i> people.  I was trying hard to avoid unnecessary dynamic relocations in the
</I>&gt;<i> ABI; clearly I failed.  I think I wasn't paying close enough attention to
</I>&gt;<i> the RTTI stuff.
</I>
Certainly a laudable goal.  I do wonder though if a better solution
wouldn't be to improve the dynamic loader; it's certainly possible to
write DLLs in C that have similarly many symbols to relocate.  It's
even more possible in Java or C#.  Not that we shouldn't do what we
can, but heck, GNOME apps written in C don't start up as fast as I'd
like either.
