Good to know I've reinvented the wheel.

Interesting idea.  But, you've spotted the major issue; a
pointer-to-member contains an implicit reference into the vtable; values
are looked up without being called.  I assume that the dynamic linker
smushes weak symbols together first and then does relocations only
against the survivors.  If we had thought of this we could have put
bits on the pointers-to-members to indicate whether they were resolved
or not.  Rats.

Nathan Meyers and I were discussing just this issue (Nathan, we're
talking about how to reduce dynamic relocations at program start) a
few days ago.  Nathan's belief (and this seems plausible) is that
most of the relocations aren't ever doing you any good; you're building
a KDE app to display a calendar and you're doing relocations that apply
to a class that implements the entire FTP protocol in a single widget,
say.  Does the prelinking stuff you refer to above try to analyze that?
If you could prove (perhaps with additional compiler assistance) that lots
of stuff in this DSO doesn't matter, and just not relocate it at all,
that might be a big win.

Also, do we take advantage of mapping the same DSOs at the same
virtual addresses across processes?  If libkdecore.so is mapped
at the same address in three processes, it's possible that all three
could actually share the same instance; relocations would only have
to be done the first time.  Even if in general you cannot prove this
is safe, it might be that for some DSOs the DSO-builder could make
that assertion.

I am now wandering into la-la land, I know.
