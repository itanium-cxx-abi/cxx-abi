[discussion of the runtime cost of fixing up all the static references to
RTTI nodes and their NTBS's; Jakub was wondering about making the NTBS's
internal to a shared object]

I was confused; only pointers to incomplete types are represented
differently.

&gt;<i> If that would be true, even better (I believe there are more relocs against

&gt;<i> The typeinfo pointer points to the typeinfo object used for RTTI. It is

</I>&gt;<i> indirectly) to incomplete types. The typeinfo pointer is a valid pointer for
</I>&gt;<i> polymorphic classes, i.e. those with virtual functions, and is zero for
</I>&gt;<i> non-polymorphic classes.
</I>
&gt;<i> which suggest that typeinfo compare should compare typeinfo pointers, not
</I>&gt;<i> __name fields.
</I>
FYI, the official website for the ABI is now 

  <A HREF="http://www.codesourcery.com/cxx-abi/">http://www.codesourcery.com/cxx-abi/</A>

but it says the same thing.  I believe that this is a case of obsolete
wording; since we decided to commonize the NTBS, there is no reason to
allow implementations to rely on being able to compare the type_info node
addresses directly.  We certainly handle type_info comparison by looking at
the NTBS address; would anyone object to new wording to disallow comparison
of type_info node addresses?
