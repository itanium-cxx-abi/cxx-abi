</I>
Really?  Comparisons of pointers to type_infos, complete with the special
trickery necessary to handle pointers to incomplete type?  Why, when they
can just as easily do pointer comparison of the NTBS?

&gt;<i> Anyhow, there are two issues, both important:
</I>
&gt;<i>   - What happens with RTLD_LOCAL?
</I>
&gt;<i>   - How can we reduce startup cost?
</I>
&gt;<i> They're somewhat different, even if they might have a related solution.
</I>
&gt;<i> My opinion is that RTLD_LOCAL is not something we should even try to
</I>&gt;<i> get right.  It's way too hard.
</I>
Yup.

&gt;<i> Startup cost happens once per program, except for any excess memory
</I>&gt;<i> used that hangs around.  So, for a long-running application (anything
</I>&gt;<i> graphical definitely qualifies) this isn't *too* important, and there
</I>&gt;<i> are techniques (caching, prelinking) that can get around the problem.
</I>
And yet it seems to be a significant problem for a significant number of
people.  I was trying hard to avoid unnecessary dynamic relocations in the
ABI; clearly I failed.  I think I wasn't paying close enough attention to
the RTTI stuff.
