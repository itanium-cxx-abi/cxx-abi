Prelinking helps there some (as I tried to explain, it has special C++ mode
in which it removes conflicts if they point into provably unused virtual
tables or type_info structures), also conflict list does not use &quot;yet more
runtime memory&quot;, it just uses more memory than it could (the conflict list
is always shorter than the sum of all reloc sections in all libraries, and
although those reloc sections take virtual memory, they are not referenced
during prelinking so with the exception of page boundaries at start and end
they will not eat any real memory).
