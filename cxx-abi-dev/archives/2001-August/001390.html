This should be no problem if NTBS are private to each library and type_infos
unique accross the whole program, if NTBS' are only referenced from type_infos
with the same name (Jason, does your &quot;only pointers to incomplete types are
represented differently&quot; mean this condition is always satisfied?).
Then it really does not matter if you compare type_info pointers or their
NTBS'.
Without any kind of prelinking, it would probably be better to have
type_infos private and NTBS COMDAT during run-time linkining, but with
prelinking this kills some optimization possibilities (particularly removing
unneeded NTBS conflicts). If NTBS are private and type_infos COMDAT, then
prelinker can optimize by seeing if a particular type_info is never used
(because its symbol is preempted by some other one earlier in the search
path) and just avoid the relocation of that type_info structure.

I don't know how could we make _ZTI symbols GLOBAL/WEAK while making
relocations against them be resolved at static link time to that symbol,
unless we special cased this in the linker, which is not a good idea IMHO.
