That works in reality too, see
<A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/ml/binutils/2001-07/msg00057.html">http://sources.redhat.com/ml/binutils/2001-07/msg00057.html</A>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/redhat/linux/beta/roswell/en/os/i386/SRPMS/prelink-0.1.3-2.src.rpm">ftp://ftp.redhat.com/redhat/linux/beta/roswell/en/os/i386/SRPMS/prelink-0.1.3-2.src.rpm</A>
The issue is that for some C++ applications, the conflict list is
unfortunately huge (say 30000 out of 100000 total relocations) because many
classes are duplicated accross many shared libs. Conflicts are far cheaper than
normal relocations, since they don't need to do any symbol lookup, but still
have the drawback that they write into memory which if nothing on a page
would be modified could be shared and also each one takes 12 resp. 24 bytes
of shareable memory which is read upon startup.

What could trim the conflict list down substantially would be some kind of
lazy virtual methods if the ABI would allow that (something similar to PLTs
for function calls), but with the difference that once resolved, it could be
written back into virtual table, so further virtual method calls would see
no performance slowdown. This way the relocation would be done only when
some virtual table is actually used, thus classes which are never used would
never need relocation of their virtual table. But the precondition for this
would be that no C++ program can ever read method pointers from virtual
tables and compare them for equality.
