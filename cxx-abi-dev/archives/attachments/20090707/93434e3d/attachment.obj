+ <li>Similarly, if C::f is a pure virtual function, no specific requirement is made

  When a class is used as a virtual base,
  we add a vcall offset slot to the beginning of its virtual table for each of
  the virtual functions it provides,
  whether in its primary or secondary virtual tables.
  Derived classes which override these functions may use the slots to
