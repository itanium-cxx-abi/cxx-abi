<fontfamily><param>Helvetica</param>Folks,



Rather than have you waiting, here is a draft for the Unwind ABI. I was unable to discuss that with Cary at that point in time, so please do not consider this final. However, this can be a good starting point for us (to avoid the 'Wait' flag :-)


The changes are marked in red, except for the following:

- Name changes (everything prefixed with _Unwind)

- Some 'type safety' added, replacing the void * with opaque types



Regards,

Christophe
