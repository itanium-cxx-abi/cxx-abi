<fontfamily><param>Helvetica</param>Gang,



After a long wait, here is a proposal for the unwind library interface. It is intended to allow multiple runtimes and/or languages to cooperate on the stack. It should also allow setjmp() or other conditions (such as thread cancellation) to perform a "C++-friendly" unwinding. Normally, both the Intel model, the "old" HP model (which, as far as I understand, is close to what IBM wanted to do) and the current HP model are compatible with this. So, I hope you won't find too many bugs in it :-)



See you tomorrow.

Christophe
