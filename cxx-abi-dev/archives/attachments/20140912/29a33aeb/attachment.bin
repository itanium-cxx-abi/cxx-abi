 This ABI does not require the generation or use of allocating

+Implicitly-defined or inline user-defined constructors and destructors are
+emitted where referenced. An implementation can emit each constructor or
+destructor in its own COMDAT group identified by the constructor or destructor
+name or it may choose to group them. It can make the decision based on any

+<p>
+If constructors for a class are grouped in a COMDAT, it is suggested that it
+be named after the constructor, but with a C5 suffix. Similarly for destructors,

+
+<p>
+If the C5/D5 COMDATs are use, the implementation must obey the following
+constraints:
+
+<ul>
+<li> A C5 comdat must have exactly C1 and C2.
+<li> If a class has a virtual destructor, the D5 comdat must have exactly
+     D0, D1 and D2.
+<li> If a class has a non-virtual destructor, the D5 comdat must have only the
+     D1 and D2 destructors. That is true even if the implementation uses D0
+     for something other than the vtable.
