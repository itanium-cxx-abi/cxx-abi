Cary gently reminded me that PDF files tend to be way smaller :-) Attached is the PDF version of the "Exception Handling for aC++ on Tahoe" specification.


This document is labelled "For HP Internal Use only". Permission is explicitly granted to the members of the IA64 C++ ABI mailing list to use it as part of the process of defining a common C++ ABI on IA64. However, this document is not an external specification, and no guarantee is made regarding its accuracy or applicability. Please do not redistribute.



Best regards

Christophe
