<PRE>Hi, all,

We are almost done, we think.  I've made updates to the documents for
yesterday's meeting as follows:

A-5 (empty parameters):  Reopened this.  It appears to be much more
trouble for the existing implementations than it is worth.  Read the
comment in the issue, and the modified writeup in 3.1.3.  Barring
screams of agony, we'll finalize this one next week.

A-30 (RTTI portability):  Accepted as written.

A-31 (layout in tail padding):  Accepted proposal to eliminate this
from Mark (empty bases are still overlaid).

3.1.1 (calling conventions):  With minor modification, should be fine now.

D-14 (__cxa_begin/end_catch):  Closed -- this has been written up for
a while now.

D-18 (__cxa_throw_type_info):  Closed after replacing this class with
its two components in the exception header and the __cxa_throw
parameter list.

F-8 (unicode):  Noone is prepared to pin this down yet.  Leave closed
without specification.

G-4 (thread-safe data initialization):  Accept the current writeup,
with the addition of a release routine that leaves the object
initialization flag unset for use when an exception is thrown
(__cxa_guard_abort).

The next normal meeting time would be Thanksgiving.  It won't happen.
After that, we have one on the schedule for 7 December, but it won't
happen either unless something new comes up.

Enjoy your reading...

Jim
