<PRE>Remember that we will be meeting on Thursday at 10:00 in the Magellan
conference room at SGI.  There are a couple of significant proposals to
discuss, so this is an important meeting.  Someone's going to be
unhappy if our attendance looks like the last meeting or two...
See in particular items 3 and 4 below.

Following is an updated agenda.  The status pages are updated and on
the web (HTML and PDF) at:

      <A HREF="http://reality.sgi.com/dehnert_engr/cxx/cxx-summary.html">http://reality.sgi.com/dehnert_engr/cxx/cxx-summary.html</A>

The contact info page is now also there, in password-protected PDF only
for privacy.  The password is &quot;not an orc&quot;.

As usual, most of the updates are in the ABI layout document, in red.
Please take a careful look at the colored text, and raise any issues
you observe.

Take a look at the material associated with the following issues.
If you see something, please send it by email.  #7 (exceptions) is most
important, and I expect to devote at least half of the meeting to it
unless noone has issues with it.  Please look it over carefully.

  1) A-30 RTTI:  I think what's there now (2.9.5(1)) is agreeable to
     everyone that's been vocal.  True?
  
  2) Please look at 3.1.1 (calling conventions).  There have been
     changes in it lately, and I think it's a bit confused.  I'd like
     the implementors to validate the steps there and tell me anything
     that's wrong.

  3) A-31: Laying out class members in padding.  We probably need to
     make an exception for volatile data.  Should we make it more
     general?  We have heard claims that the current definition is very
     hard to implement -- please be prepared to explain those claims.
     We have not heard from those who pushed hardest for this --
     Christophe as I recall -- or from anyone who has implemented it --
     Compaq I believe.  This could be a significant change, late in the
     process.  We need to resolve it.

  4) D-18: Can we replace __cxa_throw_type_info?

  5) F-7:  Unicode.  It has been suggested that, rather than just
     deferring the extended character set issue to the Open Group, we
     specify what we intend to use, at least pending a contrary
     decision.  I'm not averse to this.  But I want someone with some
     knowledge of the issue to provide me with an appropriate
     specification.

  6) G-4:  Thread-safe data initialization.  See 3.3.2.  Christophe
     had some ideas for optimization here.  I've updated 3.3.2 a bit,
     but the discussion of potential changes for Christophe's concerns
     is in the open issues page for issue G-4.  Christophe, can you
     take a look at it?

Note that it doesn't usually work to try to contact me by email
or phone the morning of the meeting, as I come directly from home.  If
you come in physically to the meeting, and the receptionist won't let
you come back to the conference room on your own, have her call the
conference room (it has a phone other than the one we use for the
meeting).
