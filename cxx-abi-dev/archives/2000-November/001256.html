<PRE>&gt;<i> The key observation is that user references generally start with a
</I>&gt;<i> fixed offset based on the compiler's view of the class declarations in
</I>&gt;<i> the header file, not on the actual runtime structure used by the
</I>&gt;<i> library.
</I>
Sure, but how would a user use a class derived from an RTTI class
type? I.e. what is the application that makes it desirable to derive
from these classes?

&gt;<i> In fact, since the user creates RTTI structures for user types, this
</I>&gt;<i> may be an issue even if there are no explicit references to the members
</I>&gt;<i> in the user source, if any data members change.
</I>
What do you mean by &quot;creates RTTI structures for user types&quot;? Like

class X:virtual something{
  fields;
} *xptr;

...
if(typeid(x)&lt;typeid(int)){...}

With that code, the user certainly instantiates typeid objects - but
those are of predefined classes, not user-defined classes
(specifically, this is a __pointer_type_info instance).

&gt;<i> So it seems to me that we must at least require that the data
</I>&gt;<i> members not change between implementations, which allows their names
</I>&gt;<i> to be normative if we like.
</I>
Agreed, yes - since the compiler will allocate the typeinfo object.

&gt;<i> We need not make any requirements about virtual functions, unless we
</I>&gt;<i> allow users to call them, or to derive from the classes.  Does
</I>&gt;<i> anyone think we should not forbid this?
</I>
&quot;this&quot; being?

&gt;<i> &gt; Why is that a concern? If a user inherits from abi::pointer_type_info,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what undesirable effects could come out of that?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the definition doesn't match what's in the library at runtime, and
</I>&gt;<i> he creates a vtable that isn't correct that ends up being referenced by
</I>&gt;<i> the runtime library, he won't be a happy camper.
</I>
Maybe that's the core of the terminology problem. &quot;Users&quot; don't create
virtual tables - or did you think that the compiler vendor is the
user, here?

Otherwise, I can see that inheriting from pointer_type_info will cause
problems if the user adds virtual functions, and then calls them
himself. I just can't see why that is a problem - we could easily
outrule inheritance from the typeinfo classes, without loss of
usability.

&gt;<i> As noted above, the vendor libcxa.so is required to be a DSO.  If you
</I>&gt;<i> integrate a non-shared library into your program, there are no
</I>&gt;<i> portability guarantees.
</I>
Ok. If then the corresponding &lt;abi.h&gt; becomes a system header, then
there won't be a problem with a mismatch - but maybe that is not
desirable.

&gt;<i> &gt; Used in the sense of being accessed - yes, why not? However, I would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not expect users ever to create typeinfo objects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They will certainly create typeinfo objects, for their user-defined
</I>&gt;<i> classes.
</I>
No, users won't - the compiler will, for them. The compiler doesn't
even need to parse abi.h to do so.

&gt;<i> - Remove the statement that data member names are not normative.
</I>
Fine.

&gt;<i> - Add a statement that the data members must be exactly as specified.
</I>
Fine.

&gt;<i> - Leave the statement that the user may not reference the virtual
</I>&gt;<i>   functions.  (Since the destructor is virtual, does this effectively
</I>&gt;<i>   forbit deriving from the classes?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does this create problems for anyone?
</I>
No, sounds fine for me.

Regards,
Martin
