<PRE>5.1.6 &quot;Scope Encoding&quot; has this to say (among other things):

&gt;<i> Occasionally entities in local scopes must be mangled too (e.g.  
</I>&gt;<i> because inlining or template compilation causes multiple translation  
</I>&gt;<i> units to require access to that entity). The encoding for such  
</I>&gt;<i> entities is as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;local-name&gt; := Z &lt;function encoding&gt; E &lt;entity name&gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> [&lt;discriminator&gt;]
</I>&gt;<i>             := Z &lt;function encoding&gt; E s [&lt;discriminator&gt;]
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;discriminator&gt; := _ &lt;non-negative number&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> The first production is used for named local static objects and  
</I>&gt;<i> classes, which are identified by their declared names. The &lt;entity  
</I>&gt;<i> name&gt; may itself be a compound name, but it is relative to the  
</I>&gt;<i> closest enclosing function, i.e. none of the components of the  
</I>&gt;<i> function encoding appear in the entity name.
</I>
This seems to suggest that the first production doesn't apply to  
member functions of local classes, nor to local enumeration types.

I assume that's unintentional since the next sentence says:

&gt;<i> It is possible to have nested function scopes, e.g. when dealing  
</I>&gt;<i> with a member function in a local class. In such cases, the function  
</I>&gt;<i> encoding will itself have &lt;local-name&gt; structure.
</I>
and the other production of &lt;local-name&gt; doesn't apply at all.

Now consider the following example:

	void x() {
	  { struct X {}; }
	  struct X {
	    void foo() { foo(); } // #1
	  } x1;
	  x1.foo();
	  { struct X {
	      void foo() { foo(); }  // #2
	    } x2;
	    x2.foo();
	  }
	}

g++ produces the following mangled names for the X::foo members:

	_ZZ1xvEN1X3fooE_0v  for #1
	_ZZ1xvEN1X3fooE_1v  for #2


Note that both have discriminators, for which the spec says:
&gt;<i> The discriminator is used only for the second and later occurrences  
</I>&gt;<i> of the same name within a single function. In this case &lt;number&gt; is  
</I>&gt;<i> n - 2, if this is the nth occurrence, in lexical order, of the given  
</I>&gt;<i> name.
</I>
The &quot;same name&quot; here is X::foo and #1 is the first occurrence (no  
discriminator needed) while #2 is the second occurrence (disciminator  
value 0).  So I would've expected instead:

	_ZZ1xvEN1X3fooEv    for #1
	_ZZ1xvEN1X3fooE_0v  for #2

Is this correct?

(EDG has a different interpretation:

	_ZZ1xvEN1X_03fooEv  for #1

	_ZZ1xvEN1X_13fooEv  for #2

but that's a bug too.)


We could change the spec to ensure that g++'s approach is  
&quot;standard&quot; (assuming that I understand what g++ really does here).   
I.e., we could specify that the &quot;discriminator&quot; discriminates the &quot;top- 
level component&quot; of colliding local names.  I think that would be  
sufficient.


Now consider a different example:

	class C {} c;

	inline int g() {
	  { struct X {}; }
	  { struct X {}; }
	  struct X {} x;
	  struct Y { int f(X x, C c) { return f(x, c); }; } y;
	  return y.f(x, c) + g();
	};

	int main() {
	  return g();
	}

(bad recursion written as a quick hack to force compilers to spill the  
inline functions).


The mangling for g()::Y::f is

	ZZ1gvEN1Y1fEZ1gvE1X_11C
	                   ^^^

The problem here is that there is no delimiter after the discriminator  
&quot;_1&quot; to separate it from the &quot;1&quot; that indicates the length of the  
class name &quot;C&quot;.  So this cannot in general be demangled.  (Such  
situations become more common in C++0x where local classes can be  
template arguments.)

Addressing this requires a change that is technically ABI breakage,  
but I think we can do it so that real-world programs are highly  
unlikely to break by saying that a &lt;discriminator&gt; is &quot;_&lt;n&gt;&quot; for &lt;n&gt;  
&lt;= 9 (that's unchanged), but &quot;__&lt;n&gt;_&quot; when &lt;n&gt; &gt;= 10 (I assume here  
that &lt;n&gt; &gt;= 10 doesn't happen in real programs).

Any thoughts?

	Daveed


P.S.: There are related issues with unnamed local classes in C++0x,  
but I plan to address those along with closure types in a separate  
proposal.
