 &gt; Suppose we have:

 &gt; 	class A { ... };
 &gt; 	class B: public A { ... };

 &gt; 	class V {
 &gt; 		...
 &gt; 		virtual A* f ();
 &gt; 		...
 &gt; 	};
 &gt; 	class W: virtual public V {
 &gt; 		...
 &gt; 		virtual B* f ();
 &gt; 		...
 &gt; 	};

 &gt; 	W *w;
 &gt; 	V *v = w;

 &gt; Suppose initially that no bases are primary.  (And check my example
 &gt; before you believe anything...)

 &gt; Now, if I call w-&gt;f(), I get the basic W::f, with no adjustments.
 &gt; This is what should happen if I use the &quot;normal&quot; entry for f in the W
 &gt; vtable.

Yes.

 &gt; If I call v-&gt;f(), it's more complicated.  I get a thunk which (a)
 &gt; adjusts v to a W*, (b) calls W::f, and (c) adjusts the resulting B*
 &gt; back to an A*.  This is what should happen if I use the &quot;normal&quot; entry
 &gt; for f in the V-in-W secondary vtable.

Yes.

 &gt; So far, so good.  The W vtable contains the overriding W::f vptr.
 &gt; The V-in-W secondary vtable contains the thunk vptr.  Nothing special
 &gt; for the covariant return types, except that the thunk is messier.

Yes.  I thought that Mark was suggesting that the W vtable in this case
would have two entries for f; that's what I was disagreeing with.

 &gt; I note, as an aside so far, that if W did not override V::f, we would
 &gt; have a &quot;promoted&quot; vptr for it in the W vtable to make it easier to
 &gt; call.  But that has nothing to do with covariant return types either.

Yes.

 &gt; Next, suppose V is the primary base of W.  Now they share a vtable, and
 &gt; therefore an f vptr.  If the f's had the same return type, there would
 &gt; be no adjustments to be made, and that f vptr could just point to the
 &gt; overriding W::f.  But because they have covariant return types, v-&gt;f()
 &gt; must still adjust on return, so the &quot;shared&quot; vptr must do that, and W's
 &gt; vtable needs to have another entry for the &quot;normal&quot; W::f vptr.

Yes, we will have two entries in the primary vtable.  One is logically part
of the V-in-W vtable, one is logically part of the W vtable.

 &gt; Finally, suppose we have:

 &gt; 	class X: virtual public W {
 &gt; 	  ...
 &gt; 	};

 &gt; Now, we specify that the vptrs from W get promoted to the X vtable.
 &gt; That presumably means both of them in the case at hand.  Correct?

I disagree with this, too.  Only the W copy should be promoted.  The V copy
is only called through a V*, so there's no reason to promote it.

Each class' vtable only needs one entry per function, regardless of
covariant returns.  The only exception comes from the case where two
classes share a vtable, but that exception is only physical; the logical
rule stands.
