<PRE>Following is an updated agenda.  The status pages are updated and on
the web (HTML and PDF) at:

	<A HREF="http://reality.sgi.com/dehnert_engr/cxx/cxx-summary.html">http://reality.sgi.com/dehnert_engr/cxx/cxx-summary.html</A>

The contact info page is now also there, in password-protected PDF only
for privacy.  The password is &quot;not an orc&quot;.

Note that it doesn't usually work to try to contact me by email
or phone the morning of the meeting, as I come directly from home.  If
you come in physically to the meeting, and the receptionist won't let
you come back to the conference room on your own, have her call the
conference room (it has a phone other than the one we use for the
meeting).

As usual, most of the updates are in the ABI layout document, in red.
The significant changes from last meeting are:

-- (Quite a bit -- see the revisions list at the top)

Please take a careful look at the colored text, and raise any issues
you observe.

Take a look at the material associated with the following issues.
If you see something, please send it by email.

  1) C-15:  Are the alternate vector allocator/deallocator routines OK?
  2) C-16:  Is the runtime for copy constructors OK?
  3) D-17:  Is the runtime for bad_cast, bad_typeid OK?
  4) B-10:  Is the runtime for pure virtual functions OK?

  5) Promoting covariant return vptrs from virtual base vtables.
     I think I've got this written up now.  Is it OK?

  6) Consistent naming for type_info data members (see Nathan's mail
     of 12 June).  I think I've got this written up now.  Is it OK?

  7) Mangling grammar modifications (see Alex Samuel's mail).
     I think I've got this written up now.  Is it OK?

  8) C-2:  Priority for constructors.  The base ABI group has
     agreed to assign us a section type for this.  I believe it is
     SHT_IA_64_PRIORITY_INIT = 0x79000000 (that is, that's what I've
     proposed, and haven't heard any complaints).

  9) G-4:  Thread-safe data initialization.  See 3.3.2.  Observe that
     Christophe has suggested a more completely contained routine
     that also handles destructor registration.

 10) C-13:  Allocating constructors.

 11) C-17:  Uncatch exception runtime.

 12) F-3:  Mangling instantiation/specialization.
     F-4:  Empty throw specifications.
     F-10: Mangling return types.

Please also give some thought to what else (not on our lists) ought to
be considered at this point.
