</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that this is not at all what is described in the
</I>&gt;<i> exception-handling document.  Then again that document is not at all
</I>&gt;<i> finished.  It doesn't say much about the Level 2 or Level 3
</I>&gt;<i> exception-handling stuff.  I don't think there's presently enough
</I>&gt;<i> there to implement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm somewhat distressed.  It looks to me like this is still pretty
</I>&gt;<i> well wide open.  In practice, I know of three compilers that will be
</I>&gt;<i> using the g++ runtime, relatively unchanged.  That means that I think
</I>&gt;<i> we should probably considering standardizing its behavior, and perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> rationalizing its naming choices, etc., but not making radical changes
</I>&gt;<i> to its existing interface.
</I>
As I think Christophe has tried to explain, this is a misleading
view of the current state of affairs.  The group has agreed to
accept the HP proposal, linked from the main status page, as the
Level II specification.  The confusion arises because that document
contains much more than that, including Level I material now in the
psABI, and Level III material.  This is partially my fault -- I have
volunteered to separate all this into the C++ ABI document, but haven't
yet had time to do so.  But in any case, I believe that we have an
agreed-upon (and fairly complete) standard, subject to the inevitable
details that will arise as it gets written down and compared to
implementations.

I will try harder to get this drafting done, but if anyone else cares
to tackle it, I won't object.
