<PRE>Following is an updated agenda, based on last week's:
 
  1) The COMDAT/section index proposals are updated in issue B-5.
     Please identify whatever needs changing (or is an issue) --
     I'll submit it in whatever form to the base ABI group early
     next week, though we can modify the proposal even after that.

     ==&gt; This has been done.
 
  2) RTTI descriptors.  See open issue A-6, and Daveed's cleaned
     up description in the ABI data layout document.

     ==&gt; Last week's work looks good to me, and it sounds like
     we're about done with this except for the issue I raised in email.
     I think we were counting on a unique RTTI record so the addresses
     could be compared, which may affect whether we can put it in
     (i.e. immediately preceding) the vtable.
 
  3) The updated vtable layout proposal from Jason.  See open issue
     B-6, and Jason's cleaned up description in the ABI data layout
     document.

     ==&gt; Matt's minutes indicate that we're ready to close this today.
 
  4) Based on (3), can we produce a clean description of a virtual
     function call?  If not, what's still missing?  See issue B-1.

  5) Same question for dynamic cast.  See issue B-8.

     ==&gt; Closed last week

  6) Identify what remains to deal with C-4, C-5, and C-6 (calling
     constructors and destructors).

  7) If possible, let's discuss the varargs routine interface,
     as there's a possible C ABI issue there (G-5).  Think about
     whether there's any chance of changing the C ABI version of
     this at this point...

     ==&gt; Closed last week

  8) Let's start the discussion of mangling.  Think about Daveed's
     list and any ideas you might have.


Next week, I'd like to return to the initialization/finalization issues
(I have an action item there), and to exception handling (Christophe
has one).
