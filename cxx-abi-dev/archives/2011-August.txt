Subject: Mangling of null pointer values
Message-ID: <4E585693.5070907@redhat.com>

DR 354 allows null pointer and member pointer values to be used as 
non-type template arguments, but the ABI doesn't seem to specify 
mangling for them.  The EDG compiler mangles them as

   L <type> 0 E

which seems right to me (regardless of the actual bitwise representation 
of null pointers to members).
