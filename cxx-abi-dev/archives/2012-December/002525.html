</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Consider the following:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> struct C : E, X { char x; };
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> char C::*c2 = x2;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> int main() { return c2 != 0; }
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I believe this program is valid and has defined behavior; per [expr.static.cast]p12, we can convert a pointer to a member of a derived class to a pointer to a member of a base class, so long as the base class is a base class of the class containing the original member.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Per the ABI, C::x is at offset 0, C::E is at offset 0, and C::X and C::X::E are at offset 1 (they can't go at 0 due to the collision of the empty E base class). So the value of c1 is 0. And the value of x is... -1. Whoops.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Finally, the conversion from x to c2 preserves the -1 value (conversion of a null member pointer produces a null member pointer), giving the wrong value for x2, and resulting in main returning 0, where the standard requires it to return 1 (likewise, returning x != 0 would produce the wrong value).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yep.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I've been aware of this for awhile and consider it an unfixable defect.  I don't know if it's generally known, though, and I can't find any prior discussion on the list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not aware of any non-artificial code that the defect has ever broken;  there are some decent just-so stories for why that might be true:
</I>&gt;<i>   (1) Data member pointers provide a really awkward abstraction that just aren't used that much:
</I>&gt;<i>     (1a) They let you abstract over any member you want!
</I>&gt;<i>     (1b) As long as that member has exactly the right type, not something implicitly convertible to it!
</I>&gt;<i>     (1c) And as long as that member is actually stored in a field, not computed from it!
</I>&gt;<i>     (1d) And as long as that field is a field of the class or one of its bases, not a field of a field of the class!
</I>&gt;<i>   (2) Everything about the syntax of member pointers &#8212; making them, using them, writing their types &#8212; is kindof weird-looking, and many people don't like using them.
</I>&gt;<i>   (3) The sorts of low-level programmers who would use this strange abstraction are often more comfortable using offsetof and explicit char* manipulation anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>   (4) People usually use data member pointers on hierarchically boring types anyway &#8212; generally leaf classes.
</I>&gt;<i>   (5) People usually don't mix data member pointers from different levels of the class hierarchy, and therefore generally don't convert do hierarchy conversions on them.
</I>&gt;<i>   (6) People usually don't work with null member pointers &#8212; they use member pointers as a way of abstracting an access for some algorithm, and generally that doesn't admit a null value.
</I>&gt;<i>   (6) Vanishingly few non-empty subclasses are ever going to be laid out at an offset of 1:
</I>&gt;<i>     (6a) The base class must have an alignment of 1, meaning (for pretty much every platform out there) no virtual functions, no interesting data structures, no pointers, no ints &#8212; nothing but bools and chars and arrays thereof.
</I>&gt;<i>     (6b) The derived class cannot have any virtual functions or virtual bases.
</I>&gt;<i>     (6c) The derived class must have multiple base classes, the first of which has to be either empty (totally empty, lacking even virtual methods) or size 1.
</I>
I went to dinner and realized that this point isn't as useful as I thought &#8212; you don't need a base class to be laid out at an offset of 1, you need a base class to be laid out immediately after a base A that has a field of size 1 at offset datasize(A)-1.  I *can* imagine a number of use cases that cause situations like this, so while most of my other points stand, it isn't quite as cut-and-dry as I made it out to be.
