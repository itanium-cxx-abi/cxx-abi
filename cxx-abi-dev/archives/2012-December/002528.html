</I>&gt;<i> Consider the following:

</I>&gt;<i> char C::*c1 = &amp;C::x;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe this program is valid and has defined behavior; per
</I>&gt;<i> [expr.static.cast]p12, we can convert a pointer to a member of a derived
</I>&gt;<i> class to a pointer to a member of a base class, so long as the base class
</I>&gt;<i> is a base class of the class containing the original member.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Per the ABI, C::x is at offset 0, C::E is at offset 0, and C::X and
</I>&gt;<i> C::X::E are at offset 1 (they can't go at 0 due to the collision of the
</I>&gt;<i> empty E base class). So the value of c1 is 0. And the value of x is... -1.
</I>&gt;<i> Whoops.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, the conversion from x to c2 preserves the -1 value (conversion of
</I>&gt;<i> a null member pointer produces a null member pointer), giving the wrong
</I>&gt;<i> value for x2, and resulting in main returning 0, where the standard
</I>&gt;<i> requires it to return 1 (likewise, returning x != 0 would produce the wrong
</I>&gt;<i> value).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yep.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I've been aware of this for awhile and consider it an
</I>&gt;<i> unfixable defect.  I don't know if it's generally known, though, and I
</I>&gt;<i> can't find any prior discussion on the list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not aware of any non-artificial code that the defect has ever broken;
</I>&gt;<i>  there are some decent just-so stories for why that might be true:
</I>&gt;<i>   (1) Data member pointers provide a really awkward abstraction that just
</I>&gt;<i> aren't used that much:
</I>&gt;<i>     (1a) They let you abstract over any member you want!
</I>&gt;<i>     (1b) As long as that member has exactly the right type, not something
</I>&gt;<i> implicitly convertible to it!
</I>&gt;<i>     (1c) And as long as that member is actually stored in a field, not
</I>&gt;<i> computed from it!
</I>&gt;<i>     (1d) And as long as that field is a field of the class or one of its
</I>&gt;<i> bases, not a field of a field of the class!
</I>&gt;<i>   (2) Everything about the syntax of member pointers &#8212; making them, using
</I>&gt;<i> them, writing their types &#8212; is kindof weird-looking, and many people don't
</I>&gt;<i> like using them.
</I>&gt;<i>   (3) The sorts of low-level programmers who would use this strange
</I>&gt;<i> abstraction are often more comfortable using offsetof and explicit char*
</I>&gt;<i> manipulation anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>   (4) People usually use data member pointers on hierarchically boring
</I>&gt;<i> types anyway &#8212; generally leaf classes.
</I>&gt;<i>   (5) People usually don't mix data member pointers from different levels
</I>&gt;<i> of the class hierarchy, and therefore generally don't convert do hierarchy
</I>&gt;<i> conversions on them.
</I>&gt;<i>   (6) People usually don't work with null member pointers &#8212; they use
</I>&gt;<i> member pointers as a way of abstracting an access for some algorithm, and
</I>&gt;<i> generally that doesn't admit a null value.
</I>&gt;<i>   (6) Vanishingly few non-empty subclasses are ever going to be laid out
</I>&gt;<i> at an offset of 1:
</I>&gt;<i>     (6a) The base class must have an alignment of 1, meaning (for pretty
</I>&gt;<i> much every platform out there) no virtual functions, no interesting data
</I>&gt;<i> structures, no pointers, no ints &#8212; nothing but bools and chars and arrays
</I>&gt;<i> thereof.
</I>&gt;<i>     (6b) The derived class cannot have any virtual functions or virtual
</I>&gt;<i> bases.
</I>&gt;<i>     (6c) The derived class must have multiple base classes, the first of
</I>&gt;<i> which has to be either empty (totally empty, lacking even virtual methods)
</I>&gt;<i> or size 1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I went to dinner and realized that this point isn't as useful as I thought
</I>&gt;<i> &#8212; you don't need a base class to be laid out at an offset of 1, you need a
</I>&gt;<i> base class to be laid out immediately after a base A that has a field of
</I>&gt;<i> size 1 at offset datasize(A)-1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You need the field to be in the derived class in order for this to be a
problem; otherwise, the cast would have undefined behavior. Hence, the base
class must be empty, and indeed must be a repeated empty base class (to not
be at offset 0).


&gt;<i>  I *can* imagine a number of use cases that cause situations like this, so
</I>&gt;<i> while most of my other points stand, it isn't quite as cut-and-dry as I
</I>&gt;<i> made it out to be.
</I>&gt;<i>
