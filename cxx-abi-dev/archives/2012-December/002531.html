</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Consider the following:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; struct E {};
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; struct X : E {};
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; struct C : E, X { char x; };

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; int main() { return c2 != 0; }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; I believe this program is valid and has defined behavior; per [expr.static.cast]p12, we can convert a pointer to a member of a derived class to a pointer to a member of a base class, so long as the base class is a base class of the class containing the original member.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Per the ABI, C::x is at offset 0, C::E is at offset 0, and C::X and C::X::E are at offset 1 (they can't go at 0 due to the collision of the empty E base class). So the value of c1 is 0. And the value of x is... -1. Whoops.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Finally, the conversion from x to c2 preserves the -1 value (conversion of a null member pointer produces a null member pointer), giving the wrong value for x2, and resulting in main returning 0, where the standard requires it to return 1 (likewise, returning x != 0 would produce the wrong value).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Yep.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Personally, I've been aware of this for awhile and consider it an unfixable defect.  I don't know if it's generally known, though, and I can't find any prior discussion on the list.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I'm not aware of any non-artificial code that the defect has ever broken;  there are some decent just-so stories for why that might be true:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   (1) Data member pointers provide a really awkward abstraction that just aren't used that much:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;     (1a) They let you abstract over any member you want!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;     (1b) As long as that member has exactly the right type, not something implicitly convertible to it!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;     (1c) And as long as that member is actually stored in a field, not computed from it!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;     (1d) And as long as that field is a field of the class or one of its bases, not a field of a field of the class!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   (2) Everything about the syntax of member pointers &#8212; making them, using them, writing their types &#8212; is kindof weird-looking, and many people don't like using them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   (3) The sorts of low-level programmers who would use this strange abstraction are often more comfortable using offsetof and explicit char* manipulation anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   (4) People usually use data member pointers on hierarchically boring types anyway &#8212; generally leaf classes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   (5) People usually don't mix data member pointers from different levels of the class hierarchy, and therefore generally don't convert do hierarchy conversions on them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   (6) People usually don't work with null member pointers &#8212; they use member pointers as a way of abstracting an access for some algorithm, and generally that doesn't admit a null value.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   (6) Vanishingly few non-empty subclasses are ever going to be laid out at an offset of 1:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;     (6a) The base class must have an alignment of 1, meaning (for pretty much every platform out there) no virtual functions, no interesting data structures, no pointers, no ints &#8212; nothing but bools and chars and arrays thereof.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;     (6b) The derived class cannot have any virtual functions or virtual bases.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;     (6c) The derived class must have multiple base classes, the first of which has to be either empty (totally empty, lacking even virtual methods) or size 1.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I went to dinner and realized that this point isn't as useful as I thought &#8212; you don't need a base class to be laid out at an offset of 1, you need a base class to be laid out immediately after a base A that has a field of size 1 at offset datasize(A)-1.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You need the field to be in the derived class in order for this to be a problem; otherwise, the cast would have undefined behavior. Hence, the base class must be empty, and indeed must be a repeated empty base class (to not be at offset 0).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think I see where you're getting that, but I'm not sure that's really
</I>&gt;<i> the intended meaning of the standard here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To elaborate, you seem to be interpreting the following text to mean
</I>&gt;<i> that members of *other bases* of the derived class cannot be casted
</I>&gt;<i> to be members of base class:
</I>&gt;<i>   If class B contains the original member, or is a base or derived
</I>&gt;<i>   class of the class containing the original member, the resulting
</I>&gt;<i>   pointer to member points to the original member.  Otherwise, the
</I>&gt;<i>   result of the cast is undefined.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It does seem to be generally true that &quot;contains&quot; means only direct
</I>&gt;<i> containment;  compare [intro.object]p3:
</I>&gt;<i>   For every object x, there is some object called the complete object
</I>&gt;<i>   of x, determined as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>     - If x is a complete object, then x is the complete object of x.
</I>&gt;<i>     - Otherwise, the complete object of x is the complete object of the
</I>&gt;<i>       (unique) object that contains x.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And the use of &quot;contains&quot; in the quote above does seem to imply
</I>&gt;<i> only direct containment, because otherwise it wouldn't need to
</I>&gt;<i> include the &quot;base or derived&quot; phrase.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, the note immediately after this uses &quot;contains&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> more loosely:
</I>&gt;<i>   although class B need not contain the original member, the dynamic
</I>&gt;<i>   type of the object on which the pointer to member is dereferenced
</I>&gt;<i>   must contain the original member
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I'm not convinced that the standard should necessarily be read that
</I>&gt;<i> closely.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> struct A { int x; };
</I>&gt;<i> struct B { int y; };
</I>&gt;<i> struct C : A, B {};
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> int B::*p = (int(B::*))(int(C::*))&amp;A::x;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ... the 'original member' is A::x, and 'the class containing the original member' is A, and B is neither a base class or a derived class of A, so the result (ahem, behavior) is undefined. Since we're talking about *the* class containing the original member, the normative wording seems unambiguous to me (and the note is true but not precise, which is what we expect from notes...).
</I>
There's definitely no rule that the dynamic type &#8212; i.e. the type of the
complete object, the most-derived class &#8212; directly contains the member to
which the member pointer refers.  I don't see how this note can be &quot;true&quot;.

&gt;<i> If it were as you described, wouldn't this have defined behavior:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> struct D : B, A {} d;
</I>&gt;<i> int k = d.*p;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Since, per [expr.mptr.oper]p4, the dynamic type of the LHS *does* contain the member, A::x, to which the RHS refers?) I'm also not sure which situations would reach the &quot;Otherwise&quot; case in your interpretation.
</I>
Good point;  my rule would need to be defined in terms of subobjects.
On the other hand, I don't think you can avoid that.  Consider:
  struct A { int x; };
  struct B : A {};
  struct C : A, C {};
  int B::*b = &amp;A::x;
  int C::*c = b;
  int A::*a = (int A::*) c;
Clearly the first two conversions here are valid, and A contains the
original member.  Why does this have undefined behavior?

And if it doesn't:
1.  That's a way to produce the collision with offset -1:  just make 'x' a char.
2.  What's the legitimate language excuse for making this defined only
when the other base class is a repeat?

John.
