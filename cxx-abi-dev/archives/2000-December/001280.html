<PRE>I apologize for being silent for the past week or two.  Configuring
new systems is always a pain...

This sounds fine to me.  And I haven't seen any objections to the
suggestion, though I also haven't seen Alex confirm his enthusiasm...
(Of course, recently this also hasn't been much work for me.)

There are two outstanding requests from the past couple of weeks,
that I could incorporate before sending the files to Alex:

 - Mark's loosening of the empty parameter language.

 - Christophe's clarification of the exception header language.

If Alex wants to get the web pages, how would he like them?  I
would suggest just sending the HTML, as the PDF is generated from
it, but could send both.  If we do move them, as Martin points out,
we would need to replace them at the SGI site with a pointer.  I'm
sure we can manage that.

I presume that noone feels a need for the 7 December meeting.

Happy Holidays,
Jim
