<PRE>The ABI often requires symbols to be emitted with vague linkage: inline functions, static data members of class temploids, RTTI objects and names for types that aren&#8217;t polymorphic classes with a key function, etc.

Vague linkage is fine during static linking*.  However, it can be really expensive if the program needs dynamic linking***, and it&#8217;s expensive even if only one shared object actually defines the symbol.

  * Well, no, it causes terrible build-time regressions, but that&#8217;s hard to avoid in the C++ translation model.**
  ** Unless you are EDG.
  *** Which is to say, always, unless you&#8217;re on a very special platform.

When the symbol is a function, a lot of this cost is avoidable, or at least postponable:
  - Direct calls and v-table references don&#8217;t care about the exact address and can potentially be resolved within the shared object.* **
  - Direct calls can use a lazy-binding stub to postpone symbol resolution until the code actually executes.

  * At least, this is legal by the language standard.  IIRC, GCC has historically not done this on the grounds that it violates the ELF standard.
  ** Although this can hurt code locality by causing multiple copies of a function to be executed.

When the symbol is a variable, including RTTI objects and names, that resolution has to occur immediately upon load.*  That&#8217;s a lot of work, but more importantly, it&#8217;s a lot of memory that has to be loaded from disk before you can even start running global constructors.

  * References from code could also use lazy binding in theory, but I don&#8217;t think anybody does this for various reasons.  References from data, like the name pointer from an RTTI object, have to be resolved immediately.

Some of that work is absolutely necessary: the language requires variables to have a single, unique address.  But the language has no such requirement on RTTI objects and names; that&#8217;s purely our requirement, done to make it more efficient to compare type_infos.

In practice, users take measures to reduce these costs, e.g. using broad-spectrum visibility switches like GCC/Clang&#8217;s -fvisibility=hidden.  If they use dynamic libraries, they then usually have to manually undo that for specific symbols, e.g. with attributes like GCC/Clang&#8217;s __attribute__((visibility(&#8220;default&#8221;))).  Symbol visibility is its own, glorious thing that some of us probably ought to standardize the computation of one of these days.  All that&#8217;s really important is that it&#8217;s not uncommon for RTTI symbols to get hidden despite actually needing to be uniqued across library boundaries.

I believe GCC and libstdc++ have recently(-ish) taken measures against that problem.  If the RTTI name starts with &#8216;*&#8217;, it is known to have a unique address; otherwise, equality/comparison must happen with strcmp.  I don&#8217;t know exactly when the library and compile use that ABI, however, or what causes the compiler to emit a name starting with &#8216;*'.

On ARM64, Apple/clang/libc++ does something very similar.  When an RTTI object would otherwise have default visibility and vague linkage, we instead give it hidden visibility and set a high bit in the RTTI object&#8217;s name pointer.*  If that bit is set on both pointers, we fall back on using string comparison.  Using a high bit means that, in the fast path, the name data never needs to be loaded at all.

  * On ARM64, the top eight bits of all pointers are reserved for shenanigans.**
  ** Not Objective-C object pointers.

The chief difference* is that Apple&#8217;s approach still requires the type to be formally given the right visibility.**   It's primarily a targeted optimization to eliminate a common need for vague linkage in the dynamic linker; it's also ARM64-specific, and on all other platforms, Apple&#8217;s clang still hews exactly to the ABI.  In contrast, I believe GCC&#8217;s approach is intended to Do The Right Thing even when types are completely mis-decorated (or at least, left undecorated under -fvisibility=hidden).

  * Ignoring the minor representation difference.
  ** Clang provides a type_visibility attribute which only controls the visibility only of a type, not its (non-type) members.  This makes it easy to formally export a type without changing the visibility rules for any of its member functions.  This is also essentially what happens with -fvisibility-ms-compat.

This seems to be a growing area of disagreement between vendors, and I wanted to bring it to the list&#8217;s attention for discussion.

John.
