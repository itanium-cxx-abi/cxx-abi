Well, to be clear, these would be recommendations for people willing to endure an ABI break.  That would still be a big NO-NO for any established platforms that care about binary compatibility.

And most of these changes are pretty minor improvements; the ABI has really held up very well.

Oh, one thing that Richard forgot:  changing the rules for RTTI uniqueness to reduce the need for coalescing weak RTTI symbols at dynamic load time.  I should probably make that a separate thread, though; Clang and GCC are both doing things in this area, but for slightly different reasons.

</I>&gt;<i> A-9 has the comment: &quot;this won't happen often&quot;, but it affects sizeof(tuple&lt;tuple&lt;int&gt;&gt;) in libstdc++. Hmm, no, it doesn't, but it would if they swapped the order of their bases (currently for tuple&lt;int,unsigned&gt; they store the unsigned before the int). Of the 3 permutations tuple&lt;int,E,E&gt;, tuple&lt;E,int,E&gt; and tuple&lt;E,E,int&gt; where E is empty, only 1 has a small size, whereas I believe at most 1 should be large (0 would be great). And that's not the only place I've hit this.

I am not sure how to interpret these comments.  Would you mind translating them into HTML #entity references, or at least section numbers, of the living document at:
