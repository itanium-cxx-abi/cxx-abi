I believe you're over-interpreting the data. :)  Compilers have been very slow to implement any of the changes from the ARM C++ ABI (except the mandatory change to member function pointers), essentially because (I believe) no major ARM-based platform has actually adopted ARM&#8217;s C++ ABI in full, essentially because compilers have been very slow to implement any of it.

The point of this proposal is that, if a vendor is motivated enough to implement a better ABI when it&#8217;s bringing up the compiler for a new platform, it&#8217;d be good to have recommendations for what to do.  And if those recommendations are actually out there and widely agreed upon, that becomes an inducement for compiler vendors to implement them, which of course makes it easier for any such new platforms to adopt them.

John.
