Right, of course it&#8217;s something that we could do given an ABI break.
What I&#8217;m saying is that the scenario that you just described...

&gt;<i> Precompiled code written for version N
</I>&gt;<i> would continue to run, but code compiled for version N+1 could take
</I>&gt;<i> advantage of the new ABI.
</I>

...is not an ABI break; version N+1 of a platform is still required to
interoperate with version N.  None of the other changes we&#8217;re discussing
would permit binary interoperation.

An ABI break is more like what Apple just had when we ported iOS to ARM64:
we didn&#8217;t have any binary compatibility requirements with previous versions
of iOS on ARM64, so we were completely free to change the ABI.

&gt;<i> This is a change I would like to see under such circumstances.
</I>
If you&#8217;d like to make a concrete proposal for a revised ABI, you&#8217;re welcome to,
and we can debate it then.  However, before we can, we really need to
understand the language feature we&#8217;d be implementing; it seems to be
somewhat underspecified.

For starters, [propagation]p8 does not define how the exception should be
copied on implementation that do perform this copy.  I presume that you'd
like it to be copied as if from a const l-value.  However, we do not appear
to be authorized to introduce a use of such a constructor; [except.throw]p5
only authorizes the compiler to check access to the constructor that would be
used to initialize the exception object from the throw operand, and in C++11,
that will often be a move constructor.

Also, substituting std::bad_exception just because we don&#8217;t know how to
copy the exception, as opposed to because copying the exception actually
failed, does not actually appear to be authorized.  The standard should define
the desired behavior when the copy constructor is non-const, inaccessible,
or defined as deleted.

John.
