I understand the point you're making, but in the specific example, Apple 
was the one bringing up a new platform (which is exactly the opportunity 
point you're referencing) and chose not to do what you describe.  And, as 
a kicker, ARM then basically went back on the platform recommendations 
they had for the 32b ABI when the spec'ed a new ABI for 64b. 

To phrase the question differently, when that platform vendor is to spec a 
new ABI (like Apple did), are the benefits of the proposed changes 
sufficient to motivate changes in what is (mostly) a machine-independent 
part of a compiler, that then has to be maintained separately, and can 
cause all sorts of distinct maintenance work?  At what point does a 
platform vendor like Apple decide to walk down a trodden path - as per 
precedent - and how high has the payoff to be to forge a new path?

The Itanium C++  ABI changes rose to a level of changeworthiness in the 
eyes of many and hence was widely implemented and adopted.  ARM's proposed 
improvements, though arguably nice, shave off a small number of cycles of 
what is otherwise a comparatively larger cost, and it seems that when 
making a cost/benefit analysis both Apple for iOS and ARM for AArch64 
chose to forgo those changes, possibly based on enablement cost vs. 
expected benefits, as you're pointing out (implicitly).
