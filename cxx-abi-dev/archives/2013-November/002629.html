I don't: that much was made quite clear at the WG21 meeting where this
was discussed.

However, I don't think it's unreasonable for version N+1 of a platform
to extend the ABI in this way. Precompiled code written for version N
would continue to run, but code compiled for version N+1 could take
advantage of the new ABI. I expect I could come up with a change that
worked nicer than my quick patch if I put some time into it.

Isn't the point of a &quot;version 2 ABI&quot; that it is different to version 1?
Richard introduced it above as &quot;a set of changes that we recommend be
made whenever a vendor has a chance to introduce an ABI break.&quot;

This is a change I would like to see under such circumstances.
