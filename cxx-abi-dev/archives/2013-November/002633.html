is, a set of changes that we recommend be made whenever a vendor has a 
chance to introduce an ABI break.

</I>|<i> &gt; In off-line discussion with John McCall, we came up with the following 
</I>list of potential changes that might be made (sorry if I forgot any):
|<i> &gt; 
</I>|<i> &gt;  * Simplify case 2b in non-POD class layout.
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i> &gt;  * Make constructors and destructors return 'this' instead of 
</I>returning 'void', in order to allow callers to avoid a reload in | common 
cases and to allow more tail calls.
|<i> &gt;  * Make virtual functions that are defined as 'inline' not be key 
</I>functions
|<i> 
</I>|<i> Credit the good folks at ARM for these two ideas.
</I>
I am curious about the history here, because it seems that the AArch64 ARM 
ABI appears to drop these changes?  Does anybody have an explanation what 
transpired to make ARM reconisder and go back to a more vanilla 
&quot;industry-standard ABI&quot; (aka Itanium ABI)? 

Did it turn out that the improvements to be gotten (e.g., by shaving off a 
few cycles for reloading this) just wasn't worth the cost of deviating 
from the center of gravity for the C++ ABI that everybody else had, or can 
we infer more substantial reasons?  (I think there may still be a few 
testcase fails for ARM32b due to different name mangling etc.)

Also, the  iOS ABI on 32b ARM seems to have stepped back from the full 
scope of the ARM 32b ABI?   Any thoughts what is pulling these ABIs back 
into the  mainline?

Not only that, but it appears that those who departed on the occasion of 
an ABI break seem to have come back into the fold on the next ABI break?
