<PRE>&gt;<i>From: Cary Coutant &lt;<A HREF="http://sourcerytools.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/cxx-abi-dev">cary at cup.hp.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>Many of you are probably aware of (and several of you participated in) 
</I>&gt;<i>a discussion thread on the gcc-patches mailing list about a new unwind 
</I>&gt;<i>API that Richard Henderson had to add to support forced unwinds 
</I>&gt;<i>resulting from (among possibly other things) thread cancellation. I 
</I>&gt;<i>thought it would be appropriate to bring this issue to this mailing list.
</I>
Jerry Harrow from the pre merger Compaq side of HP has some thoughts on
this.  He said they did something like this and at the base of each thread
was a &quot;catch&quot; block.

And for every throw spec, it quantum tunneled through them.

&gt;<i>As I understand the central issue, we would like to run C++ cleanups on 
</I>&gt;<i>a thread cancellation, in addition to the cleanups registered through 
</I>&gt;<i>the POSIX C bindings to the pthreads library. Cleanups resulting from 
</I>&gt;<i>local automatic objects that need destruction are easy, but the problem 
</I>&gt;<i>is what to do about catch(...) blocks. Richard's approach was to end 
</I>&gt;<i>such blocks with a call to the new API, &quot;_Unwind_Resume_or_Rethrow()&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i>if the block did not already end with a rethrow.
</I>-cary

He didn't say anything about those?
