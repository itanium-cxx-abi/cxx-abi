Yes.

</I>
Rather, a rethrow at the end of a catch(...) block uses that API instead of
the usual rethrow code.  If the block doesn't end with a rethrow, nothing
is changed.

&gt;<i> I think Jason Merrill hit the nail on the head when he said (on 4/30):

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There was some discussion about whether catch(...) blocks should run at all

</I>&gt;<i> exceptions, and must be allowed to proceed.
</I>
Actually, the consensus was that we should call terminate() if we try to
unwind through a throw().  Allowing it to go through would destroy the
optimization benefits of throw().

&gt;<i> On the former issue, however, there didn't seem to be a clear resolution.
</I>
Everyone agreed that we would like to be able to run cleanups; the problem
was telling them apart from other cases.

I came up with a solution: use terminate() as the destructor for the forced
unwind exception object.  That way, we can just run all catch(...) blocks.
If it rethrows, we continue to unwind normally, but if it exits some other
way, we try to destroy the exception object, which calls terminate().

Everyone seemed to like this solution for forced unwind.  The issue on
which there was disagreement was whether or not cancellation should be
treated like longjmp_unwind.  Several people argued that cancellation
should be a normal exception which can be caught and discarded.
