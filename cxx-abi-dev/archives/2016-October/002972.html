</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Shouldn't the ABI document specify how type_info entries are collated and hashed with their before() and hash_code() members?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, that seems reasonable.  It's only necessary for interoperation of multiple standard libraries on a platform, but that's a thing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since the ABI only formally guarantees that the names are uniqued, I think the obviously correct way of implementing these is to compare name pointers in before() and reinterpret the name pointer as the result of hash_code().  That is what libc++ seems to do.  I don't have a recent libstdc++ header around; the ancient one I do have uses that rule for before() and doesn't implement hash_code(), but IIRC these days libstdc++ uses a variant ABI for type_info anyway.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> libstdc++ has two modes: in one mode, it guarantees typeinfo name uniqueness across the program, uses the pointer for before(), and reinterprets the pointer as a hash for hash_code. In the other mode (where they try to merge types from a .so even if it was dlopen'd RTLD_LOCAL [1]), some names are unique and others are not; hash_code computes a hash of the name, and before ... well, before is broken, and doesn't produce a strict weak order.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this set by environment variable or by #define?  I suppose the latter would technically work if done consistently enough in program code to paper over the ODR problems, since the parts of the ABI library that do type_info comparisons (for dynamic_cast and exceptions) are unlikely to use either before() or hash_code().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It looks like it's a libsupc++ configure-time #define.
</I>
Ah, so basically a platform decision, then.  Although I guess it's probably more plausible to swap in your own libsupc++ on Linux than it would be on Darwin.

&gt;&gt;<i>  [1]: It would seem reasonable for the ABI document to say something about what happens in this case. If I understand correctly, the issue is that a .so that's dlopen'd RTLD_LOCAL can contain a weak definition of the type_info for a type that's logically part of another library, and if it's loaded before that other library is, the type_info name doesn't get merged despite there being some intent that it's the same type.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose I can't just say that that's an ELF problem. :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What we did for ARM64 seems like the right basic approach: the type_info object records whether it's unique or non-unique, and non-unique RTTI just falls back on string-based comparisons / hashes.  The type_info is unique if and only if it's for a fundamental type in the ABI library or a polymorphic class with a key function.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's approximately what GCC does. IIRC, you guys use a tag bit for the local/non-local choice, whereas GCC prepends the name with '*' for the case where a pointer comparison is applicable. The tag bit approach seems substantially better, since it doesn't require first fetching through the pointer in order to tell that we didn't actually need to fetch through the pointer :)
</I>
Yep, that's why we did it that way. :)

Does GCC just always emit unique RTTI with the '*' prefix, or does it rely on being configured the same way as libsupc++?

&gt;<i> On the other hand, GCC has a trick you don't mention here: it also treats internal-linkage types has having unique type_info.
</I>
Oh, yes, we do that as well.

John.
