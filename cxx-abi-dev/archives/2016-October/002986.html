</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the noexceptness of a function type is now part of the type. As a result,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we need manglings for exception-specifications on function
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pointer/reference types:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> void f(void()) {}
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> void f(void() noexcept) {} // ok, overload not redefinition
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (It's not clear to me whether or not this was also necessary prior to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> C++17 to handle dependent exception specifications that appear lexically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> within the parameter list of a function template, and actual implementation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> practice varies as to whether such exception specifications are SFINAEable.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In order to handle overloading/SFINAE on exception specifications in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dependent cases, we need to be able to mangle not only &quot;noexcept&quot;, but also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;noexcept(expression)&quot; and &quot;throw(&lt;types&gt;)&quot;. Suggestion for manglings:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;exception-spec&gt; ::=
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   nx  -- non-throwing exception specification
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   nX &lt;expression&gt; E  -- computed (value-dependent) noexcept
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   tw &lt;type&gt;* E  -- throw (types)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;function-type&gt; ::= [&lt;CV-qualifiers&gt;] [&lt;exception-spec&gt;] [Dx] F [Y]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;bare-function-type&gt; [&lt;ref-qualifier&gt;] E
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the case of throw(a, b, c), we could omit types that are neither
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instantiation-dependent nor pack expansions (if that omits all types, we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can use the 'nx' mangling instead), since C++17 says you can't overload on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the actual types in the dynamic exception specification, and we otherwise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only need them to be present if they might result in a substitution failure.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thoughts?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think this is an amazingly late change to the language with pretty thin
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> justification; does that count?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This really is a major change which can reasonably be expected to cause
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> substantial source and binary breakage.  The proposal mentions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transaction_safe as a feature that added similar complexity, but that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> analogy is weak because (1) TM is expected to be an optional TS, whereas
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> noexcept is a mandatory core language feature, and (2) existing code does
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not use the transaction_safe attribute, whereas noexcept and throw() have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seen widespread adoption, in the latter case for years.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If it is a goal of this proposal to eliminate the underspecified fake
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> type system around exception specifications, it is worth noting that it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completely fails to do so, since the checking rules for direct function
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pointer assignments are still quite a bit stronger than those provided by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the new type system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That was indeed a goal here. Can you expand on how it fails? Ignoring the
</I>&gt;<i> (deprecated) dynamic exception specifications, this new approach seems
</I>&gt;<i> stronger than the old type system, since it works for function types being
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrarily nested within other types, not just one level deep within
</I>&gt;<i> function types and pointers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are there any implementations which actually plan to throw out the dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> exception specification matching logic?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
*shrug* Maybe MSVC? Any conforming C++17 implementation will need to demote
that side of their enforcement to a warning. And I think there are NB
comments for C++17 proposing that we apply
<A HREF="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0003r4.html">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0003r4.html</A> for
C++17 rather than waiting for C++20.

&gt;<i> Hmm, I thought we had added a rule to allow B to be deduced in
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   template&lt;class R, class ...A, bool B&gt; void f(R(A...) noexcept(B));
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> but it looks like we actually didn't. =(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, that would work pretty well for this case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, the above is a problem, if noexcept function types start to appear in
</I>&gt;<i> existing code (for instance through use of decltype or by code that passes
</I>&gt;<i> around noexcept function pointers).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, recall that noexcept function types have always been writable; they
</I>&gt;<i> just didn't necessarily get enforced reliably.  Also, noexcept and throw()
</I>&gt;<i> are pretty popular, and aren't there proposals to infer them in more cases?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Proposals, yes, but nothing in C++17.


&gt;<i> It's really hard to say abstractly how much impact this will have.
</I>&gt;<i> There's a lot of potential for breakage, but it's also quite possible that
</I>&gt;<i> there won't be many changes and that almost all of them will be lost in the
</I>&gt;<i> great grey expanse of C++ binary compatibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We'll have an implementation soon, and then we can find out whether this is
a problem in practice.

&gt;<i> You will note that I have omitted the necessary specializations for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;transaction_safe&quot;, as well as the incredibly common extension of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specialized calling conventions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This also breaks source compatibility for template matching, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> basically every function template in the standard library is going to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change manglings (and become *much* larger) due to noexcept expressions now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being mangled.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a problem, but I don't think it's as bad as you claim. The mangling
</I>&gt;<i> of a function still wouldn't include its exception specification; this
</I>&gt;<i> would only affect mangling in cases where a parameter or return type or
</I>&gt;<i> template argument involves a function type with an exception-specification
</I>&gt;<i> -- a lot less common than every function template in the standard library,
</I>&gt;<i> but this still does change manglings for existing code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, so it only triggers SFINAE failures in nested function types, and
</I>&gt;<i> you can't overload templates by it?  I agree that that helps a lot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And the entire proposal seems to have forgotten about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reference-to-function types.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The change to [dcl.init.ref]p4 allows a reference to non-noexcept function
</I>&gt;<i> to bind to a noexcept function, and this indirectly allows the same during
</I>&gt;<i> overload resolution, casts, and so on. What additional considerations were
</I>&gt;<i> missed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hadn't realized that the expression logic was so consistent about
</I>&gt;<i> defining e.g. the behavior of the conditional operator on l-values in terms
</I>&gt;<i> of reference binding.  I apologize.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...I see that this adds a new special case to exception handling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes; I'd forgotten to mention this side of the ABI change.

We'll also need a new flag on type_info objects to model this. In line with
the transaction_safe changes that Jason proposed, I suggest adding a
__noexcept_mask = 0x40 to __pbase_type_info, and representing a pointer to
noexcept function as a pointer with __noexcept_mask bit set to the
corresponding *non-noexcept* function pointer type.

John.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But if we're just talking about manglings, then yes, I think your ABI
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal is basically fine. :)  It's a little unfortunate to include this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kind of discrimination so early in the mangling, because some object/image
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> file symbol tables optimize for symbols with common prefixes, but our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mangling scheme is generally poor at achieving that anyway.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> John.
