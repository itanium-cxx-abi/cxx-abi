&gt;<i> I'll admit that I don't attend committee meetings, but I thought that implementation experience was expected *prior* to standardization, not something that gets done months after voting the thing in concurrently with the committee finalizing the language in a draft for next year's release.
</I>
That&#8217;s cute ;-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You will note that I have omitted the necessary specializations for &quot;transaction_safe&quot;, as well as the incredibly common extension of specialized calling conventions.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This also breaks source compatibility for template matching, and basically every function template in the standard library is going to change manglings (and become *much* larger) due to noexcept expressions now being mangled.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It's a problem, but I don't think it's as bad as you claim. The mangling of a function still wouldn't include its exception specification; this would only affect mangling in cases where a parameter or return type or template argument involves a function type with an exception-specification -- a lot less common than every function template in the standard library, but this still does change manglings for existing code.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Okay, so it only triggers SFINAE failures in nested function types, and you can't overload templates by it?  I agree that that helps a lot.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And the entire proposal seems to have forgotten about reference-to-function types.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The change to [dcl.init.ref]p4 allows a reference to non-noexcept function to bind to a noexcept function, and this indirectly allows the same during overload resolution, casts, and so on. What additional considerations were missed?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I hadn't realized that the expression logic was so consistent about defining e.g. the behavior of the conditional operator on l-values in terms of reference binding.  I apologize.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...I see that this adds a new special case to exception handling.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes; I'd forgotten to mention this side of the ABI change.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We'll also need a new flag on type_info objects to model this. In line with the transaction_safe changes that Jason proposed, I suggest adding a __noexcept_mask = 0x40 to __pbase_type_info, and representing a pointer to noexcept function as a pointer with __noexcept_mask bit set to the corresponding *non-noexcept* function pointer type.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I strongly disagree; we should take this opportunity to revisit that decision.  The floodgates are open, and this set of function type attributes is clearly going to grow over time.  (It's actually transaction_safe that really drives this point home; noexcept is at least a longstanding part of the core language in various forms.)  We also have a lot of vendor-specific function type attributes that are part of the type but just aren't standardized and can't be represented in type_info.  I don't think it makes sense to indefinitely keep hacking these things into the pointer type flags; we should just bite the bullet and create a new function_type_info subclass.
</I>
I agree with you (John).

(That said, I&#8217;ll keep resisting adding standard bifurcations to function types. &#8220;contracts&#8221; and one alternative for coroutines are currently trying to add to that list.)
