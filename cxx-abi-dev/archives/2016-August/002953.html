</I>

Yes, but the bindings are always of reference type when they exist at all.
In a decomposition declaration like:

  auto [a, b, c] = expr;

there are (potentially, see below) four distinct entities: a variable

  auto e = expr;

and three bindings (a, b, and c). The mangling above would be used for the
'e' variable. There is no way to reference that implicit variable except
through the bindings.

There are two different cases for the behavior of the bindings: either they
are built-in bindings representing some subobject of e (including bitfield
members) with no corresponding entity, or (for types like std::tuple) they
act as variables of reference type initialized by some user-specified
expression which can have arbitrary side-effects (the corresponding
extension mechanism involves specializing standard-library templates and
providing a function template to be found by ADL, and has no ABI impact).

For the built-in case, it seems most straightforward to not generate
globals at all (and emit references to a, b, and c directly as references
to the corresponding subobject of e), but for the user-defined extension
case, code is run to initialize the bindings and they generally need to act
like global variables. A pedantic reading of the standard suggests that you
could do this:

  auto [a] = std::tuple&lt;int&gt;(0); // tu1.cc

  extern int &amp;&a; // tu2.cc

... which would certainly restrict the ABI choices, but I don't think that
was an intended consequence of the rules.

There is (currently) no way to declare the same decomposition declaration
across multiple translation units (there's a syntactic limitation
preventing them from being static locals, inline globals, or static data
members), so in that sense there is no formal ABI impact.
