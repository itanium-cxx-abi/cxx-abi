<PRE>(Re-posting after a couple of weeks due to mailing list transition issues.)

As you can tell from the subject line keywords we're well in &quot;odd corner case&quot; territory here, but we received an ABI compatibility problem report in this area.

Consider:

	struct S {
	  int i;
	  long long x: 130;
	  int j;
	};

What's the offset of j?

Here is what the IA-64 C++ ABI has to say wrt. bit field allocation (2.4.II/1):

&gt;<i> If D is a (possibly unnamed) bitfield whose declared type is T and whose declared width is n bits:
</I>&gt;<i> There are two cases depending on sizeof(T) and n:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	&#8226; If sizeof(T)*8 &gt;= n, the bitfield is allocated as required by the underlying C psABI, subject to the constraint that a bitfield is never placed in the tail padding of a base class of C.
</I>&gt;<i> If dsize(C) &gt; 0, and the byte at offset dsize(C) - 1 is partially filled by a bitfield, and that bitfield is also a data member declared in C (but not in one of C's proper base classes), the next available bits are the unfilled bits at offset dsize(C) - 1. Otherwise, the next available bits are at offset dsize(C).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Update align(C) to max (align(C), align(T)).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	&#8226; If sizeof(T)*8 &lt; n, let T' be the largest integral POD type with sizeof(T')*8 &lt;= n. The bitfield is allocated starting at the next offset aligned appropriately for T', with length n bits. The first sizeof(T)*8 bits are used to hold the value of the bitfield, followed by n - sizeof(T)*8 bits of padding.
</I>&gt;<i> Update align(C) to max (align(C), align(T')).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In either case, update dsize(C) to include the last byte containing (part of) the bitfield, and update sizeof(C) to max(sizeof(C),dsize(C)).
</I>


Here we're dealing with the second bullet because sizeof(long long)*8 &lt; 130 (long long is 8 bytes). We emulate GCC modes that permit 128-bit integral types, and in those modes, T' is __int128, a 16-byte aligned type.  That means that the addition of __int128 has changed the layout of a structure that doesn't involve __int128 at all!

GCC keeps the alignment of the bit field at an 8-byte boundary in this case, and that makes sense to me, but for:

	struct S2 {
	  int i;
	  __int128 x: 130;
	  int j;
	};

it does the same, which does not make sense to me: If I used a __int128 type for the field, I presumably want the associated alignment used.

I'd like to therefore propose changing this such that:

	- for standard C++11 integral types use the existing rule
	- for integral types not defined in C++11, limit T' to the standard C++11 types and the declared bit field container type

What do you all think?
