I think we should update the ABI document (in 3.1.1/1) to make this work (perhaps something equivalent to replacing &quot;non-trivial&quot; with &quot;non-trivial, non-public, or deleted&quot; each time it occurs).

</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Accessible&#8221; does not mean &#8220;public&#8221;.  That&#8217;s a standards bug: we need to be able to decide the ABI signature of a function at its point of declaration, not have it be dependent on whether there exist (or might exist) calls to it which would not be allowed to use a privately-defaulted trivial copy constructor.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see anything wrong with the standard here. Inaccessible implies non-public for these members (because they're not inherited from a base class), so the ABI can look for a public special member where the standard says any accessible special member is permitted to be called.
</I>
Inaccessible does imply non-public, but accessibility in general is context-sensitive.

Are you asking for the ABI rule to actually be &#8220;non-public, non-trivial, or deleted&#8221;?  I agree that that&#8217;s what the standard is requesting, because it&#8217;s the only way we can guarantee at the point of declaration of a function that all callers will be able to access the special member.  However, it&#8217;s not the current practice of any compiler, probably because we generally try quite hard to prevent access control from affecting the ABI, e.g. because it seems unfortunate for things like &quot;#define private public&#8221; to actually break binary compatibility.  (I&#8217;ll grant that it&#8217;s legal under the standard, and it might also already affect the ABI in corner cases by making a base class suddenly POD.)

John.
