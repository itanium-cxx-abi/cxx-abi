<PRE>Martin,  Your observation may be the key here.  we are mangling ::locale::
_Impl.  Is the following sequence of productions correct?

&lt;nested-name&gt; ::= N [&lt;CV-qualifiers&gt;] &lt;prefix&gt; &lt;unqualified-name&gt; E    &lt;&lt;
there is no substitution here.  _Impl is the unqualified name
   &lt;prefix&gt; ::= &lt;prefix&gt; &lt;unqualified-name&gt;
&lt;&lt; here we would subst S_ for locale which we've seen
      &lt;prefix&gt; ::= empty

This would yield NS_5ImplE.

The first question is whether both these manglings follow the
grammar. This is indeed the case, in &lt;type&gt;, we have

  R &lt;type&gt;

so R is followed by a type. One alternative for &lt;type&gt; is
&lt;substitute&gt;, so

  R S0_

is clearly a valid mangling for a type. I assume you agree that your
proposed mangling is also possible for that grammar.

Now, the question is which of these manglings is the correct one.

As you indicate,

S_  is ::locale
S0_ is ::locale::_Impl

In 5.1.7, the ABI spec says

# Logically, the substitutable components of a mangled name are
# considered left-to-right, components before the composite structure
# of which they are a part. If a component has been encountered
# before, it is substituted as described below. This decision is
# independent of whether its components have been substituted, ...

For locale::_Impl, we first check for ::locale, and subsitute this as
S_::_Impl. Then we consider the composite structure,
i.e. ::locale::_Impl, which also has been encountered before. So we
clearly must replace ::locale::_Impl with S0_ (even though the
::<i>locale component has already been substituted). The intention here
</I>is to always substitute as large structures as possible.

Now the question might be whether to mangle this as NS0_E or just as
S0_. Of those, only S0_ is allowed, since, in a &lt;nested-name&gt;, you
must have an &lt;unqualified-name&gt; or &lt;template-args&gt; after a
&lt;substitution&gt;.

So the g++ mangling is correct, and your proposed mangling is
incorrect.

Regards,
Martin
