Hello,

I'd like to continue some discussion on the topic of mangling lambda  
closure types.

In the thread of December, I suggested:

Later in that thread, I also suggested that nonlocal uses of lambdas  
don't need to be matched across translation units, because they'd have  
different types in two translation units.  For example:

	// File x.h:
	decltype([]{}) *p;  // ODR violation-bait

	// File y.c:
	#include "x.h"

	// File z.c:
	#include "x.h"

The occurrence of the lambda in y.c and z.c produces two distinct  
types, and so both translation units cannot be part of the same program.

That said, an encoding is probably needed for lambdas that appear in a  
class definition.  E.g.:

	struct S {
	  typedef decltype([]()) LT;
	  void f(LT);
	};

which means that the minimal encoding above should be extended to  
cover lambdas in nonlocal class definitions.


We're also wondering if it would be worthwhile to add some additional  
information to the minimal encoding so that the demangled version can  
be more useful to programmers.

For example, with a minimal encoding as proposed, the demangled output  
might look like:
	lambda#1 in f(int)
which doesn't say much about the lambda's salient properties.

Would it be worthwhile to also encode the "signature" of the  
operator() so that we could instead demangle it as
	lambda(int)->void in f(int) (#1)
?
