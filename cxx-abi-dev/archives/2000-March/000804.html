<PRE>Following is an updated agenda.  The status pages are updated and on
the web at:

	<A HREF="http://reality.sgi.com/dehnert_engr/cxx/cxx-summary.html">http://reality.sgi.com/dehnert_engr/cxx/cxx-summary.html</A>

The contact info page is now also there, in password-protected PDF only
for privacy.  The password is &quot;not an orc&quot;.

As usual, most of the updates are in the ABI layout document, in color.
The significant changes from last week are:

 - Addition of Coleen's alternate construction vtable proposal.

 - Further additions/changes to the mangling writeup. 

Please take a careful look at the colored text.  I'll start off by
going through it all carefully to resolve any questions.

Take a look at the material associated with the following issues.

  1) C-4:  Construction vtables.  Coleen will be here, so I'd like
     to get this as much done as we can.  Please try to carefully
     understand the proposals.

  2) F-1:  Mangling.  Settle the substitution dictionary.
     Any other issues with what's there?  It would be useful if
     people would go through the examples and make sure they match
     what's expected, and if additional examples could be contributed.

  3) F-2:  Mangled name size.  Our hope has been that the substitution
     mechanism will make further efforts unnecessary.  How do we go
     about validating this?  Martin's first data are excellent -- does
     anyone else have some examples for him?

  3) F-4:  Empty throw specifications.  Should we deal with this in
     the mangling?

  4) F-6:  Demangler?

  5) F-7:  Mangling statics.

  6) A-23:  RTTI for incomplete types.

  7) D-12:  Unwind table location.
