Ok, thanks for the clarification about that. Let me just see if I
understand DSO linking properly. If we have a loaded object file which
refered to a non-defined weakly declared symbol, that object file will
have resolved the symbol to zero. Loading a DSO which defines that
symbol will not affect the already loaded object file, which remains
having the value zero. Ok?

Ok, this needs more documentation. There are three uses for the rtti
information, which we _don't_ have to solve with the same rtti object.
We have attempted to use a single type_info for all three uses, but
that is not necessary, and in some cases we have separate objects (of
the same type, __pointer_type_info) for the same type (T *...*, for
incomplete T).

1) A distinct lvalue for the typeid operator
2) A class heirarchy descriptor for dynamic_cast
3) A class heirarchy and pointer qualification descriptor for catch
matching.

Consider a source file `foo' consisting of these snippets
        struct A;
        typeid (A *); //1
        catch (A **); //2
1 would produce a __pointer_type_info of the following shape
tf_P1A: comdat  ; call this foo.tf_P1A
        name = &quot;P1A&quot;
        flags = 0
        target = weak tf_1A

The TU would not need to emit the (incomplete) type_info for A itself,
but leave a dangling weak reference. That will become zero, unless
another TU is linked in which provides it.

2 must produce information about the entire pointer chain, from the
layout doc that would be
_tf_PP1A: static
        name = &quot;PP1A&quot;
        flags = 8
        target = _tf_P1A
_tf_P1A: static
        name = &quot;P1A&quot;
        flags = 8
        target = _tf_1A
_tf_1A: static
        name = &quot;1A&quot;

Ok?

Now, if we another source `baz' with a definition of A,
        struct B {};
        struct A : B {};
        typeid (A *); //1a
        catch (A **); //2a
        throw (A *)NULL;  //3a

1a would produce the same __pointer_type_info as before, but this time
we would emit comdat typeinfo for the catch clause 2a, and throw 3a is
also permitted.
tf_PP1A: comdat
        name = &quot;PP1A&quot;
        flags = 0
        target = tf_P1A
tf_P1A: comdat  ; call this baz.tf_P1A
        name = &quot;P1A&quot;
        flags = 0
        target = tf_1A
tf_1A: comdat
        name = &quot;1A&quot;
        base = tf_1B
tf_1B: comdat
        name = &quot;1B&quot;

of course tf_P1A is the same object that 1a forced us to emit.

Now the $BIGNUM dollar question. What if `foo' is our executable and
`baz' is the DSO? foo.tf_P1A will be the `active' definition of tf_P1A,
and it will have a NULL target value. Therefore baz.tf_P1A is not
selected and baz.tf_PP1A's target will resolve to foo.tf_P1A. Also the
throw 3a will refer to tf_P1A, which will be resolved by foo.tf_P1A.
That has an incomplete target type, so 3a won't have information about
A being derived from B, and thus won't match a catch (B *) clause.

Perhaps I'm being dense, and there's still something about comdat
linkage I don't understand. But to my understanding the previous
paragraph is the same problem with DSO's I originally raised before
this incomplete type info was addressed.
