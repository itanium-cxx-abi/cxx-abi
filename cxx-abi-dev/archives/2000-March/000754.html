<PRE>Following is an updated agenda.  The status pages are updated and on
the web at:

	<A HREF="http://reality.sgi.com/dehnert_engr/cxx/cxx-summary.html">http://reality.sgi.com/dehnert_engr/cxx/cxx-summary.html</A>

The contact info page is now also there, in password-protected PDF only
for privacy.  The password is &quot;not an orc&quot;.

As usual, most of the updates are in the ABI layout document, in color.
Aside from the straightforward resolutions from the last meeting, I've:

 - Reorganized the vtable writeup to eliminate ordering confusion.

 - Made changes in the construction vtable writeup based on the
   meeting.  I think it's much clearer about content.

 - Heavily reworked the mangling writeup, incorporating a pseudo-BNF
   grammar, adding a few constructs from the loose ends list, and
   fixing examples.

Please take a careful look at the colored text.  I'll start off by
going through it all carefully to resolve any questions.

Take a look at the material associated with the following issues.

  1) C-4:  Construction vtables.  Let's make sure we understand what
     remains, so we can close this when Coleen comes out next week
     (or come close).

  2) F-1:  Mangling.  Any problems with my changes?  Are loose ends
     proposals OK?  Examples issues?

     Let's talk about the name reuse mechanism.  I've suggested that
     we identify which constructs can be used as substitutes, and be
     substituted themselves, in terms of the grammar.  If this seems
     like a reasonable approach, let's go through the grammar in the
     layout document and identify the acceptable substitutes.

  3) F-2:  Mangled name size.  Our hope has been that the substitution
     mechanism will make further efforts unnecessary.  How do we go
     about validating this?

  3) F-4:  Empty throw specifications.  Should we deal with this in
     the mangling?

  4) F-6:  Demangler?

  5) F-7:  Mangling statics.

  6) A-23:  RTTI for incomplete types.

  7) D-12:  Unwind table location.

Issues that are active and awaiting proposals:

  a)  A-24:  Incomplete type RTTI (alternate proposal from Christophe).
