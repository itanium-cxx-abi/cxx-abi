<PRE>Hi,

I'm again puzzled as to how the new rtti scheme is supposed to work
with incomplete types. There's a contradiction in the layout doc. The
contradiction is understandable if you know what the intention is, but
I think it'd be confusing to someone reading this cold (it's still
confusing to me).

* `Assuming that after linking and loading only one type_info
  structure is active'.
* `Two abi::__pointer_type_info objects are compared for equality (i.e.
  of the types represented) by checking for equal target type RTTI
  pointers unless either or both have the incomplete flag set, in
  which case the pointed-to RTTI structures must be checked for
  equality (described below).'

The former is refering to complete types. As any `T cv *' is a complete
type, to test for equality of such a type only requires pointer
comparison of the type_info's representing that type. It is when
determining the equality of the targets for differently qualified `T cv
*' instances with incomplete T that we have to deal with multiple
instances of the __class_type_info for T. This type of comparison is
only of interest when looking for a qualification conversion on catch
matching. It is only the pointer to T which needs to consider this, a
pointer to pointer to T will not need to know about the completeness of
T.

So why does the __pointer_type_info class's incomplete target type
(0x8) apply when the ultimate non-pointer type is incomplete? I think
it should just apply when the immediately pointed-to type is
incomplete. 

Secondly I don't see how making the incomplete class type object static
linkage will avoid preemption. Suppose translation unit 1 contains
        struct A;
        ...
        typeid (A *);
and unit 2 contains
        struct B {};
        struct A : B {};
        ...
        typeid (A *);

The `typeid (A *)' objects emitted in 1 and 2 will have comdat linkage
and so only one will be active in the final program. We have no control
over which is actually selected by the linker (I don't think the linker
cares, because it is assuming that any comdat's named the same have the
same contents - yes?). Now, which of the abi::__class_type_info's for A
will the selected one point to? For this to work it must be the one in 2,
as that contains the complete information about the type. Will static
linkage of 1's instance behave this way? We need to specify that 1's
instance has weak linkage.

I suggest,

`If the target type of the pointer is an incomplete class type, directly
or indirectly, a dummy class RTTI is generated for the incomplete type
that will not resolve to the final complete class RTTI (because the
latter need not exist), possibly by making it a local static object,
and the incomplete target type flag is set in each pointer RTTI that
references it directly or indirectly. 

Two abi::__pointer_type_info objects are compared for equality (i.e. of
the types represented) by checking for equal target type RTTI pointers
unless either or both have the incomplete flag set, in which case the
pointed-to RTTI structures must be checked for equality (described
below).'

be replaced by

`If the target type of the pointer is an incomplete class type, a dummy
abi::__class_type_info is generated for the incomplete type. The dummy
instance is given weak linkage so it will not conflict with the complete
RTTI object which might be provided in another translation unit. The
abi::__pointer_type_info object which points to this incomplete type has
its incomplete target type flag set.'

`Two abi::__pointer_type_info objects are compared for equality in the
normal way, by comparing their addresses.  Checking for equality of the
pointed-to objects requires checking the incomplete target type flags of
the two (different) pointer objects. If neither is set, then the targets
can be compared in the normal way. If either is set then the NTBS of the
target type_info objects must be compared.'

`Note: Two different abi::__pointer_type_info objects can only point to
the same type, if the target type is differently qualified in each
pointer.'

The following paragraph describing abi::__class_type_info should be
deleted.

`Two abi::__class_type_info objects are normally compared for equality
(i.e. of the types represented) by comparison of their addresses.
However, incomplete class RTTI objects, which can only be accessed via
abi::__pointer_type_info objects, must be compared for equality by
comparison of the name NTBS in their std::type_info bases. '

The following paragraph

`This RTTI class may also be used for incomplete class types when
referenced by a pointer RTTI, in which case it must be prevented from
preempting the RTTI for the complete class type, for instance by
emitting it as a static object (without external linkage).'

should be replaced by

`This RTTI class may also be used for incomplete class types when
referenced by a pointer RTTI, in which case it must be prevented from
preempting the RTTI for the complete class type, by giving it
weak linkage.'

With these changes, given
        struct A;
type_info's will be of the following form (using gcc's mangling
&amp; __attribute__)

__class_type_info tf_1A __attribute__ ((weak)) (&quot;1A&quot;); // typeid (A)
__pointer_type_info tf_P1A (&quot;P1A&quot;, 0x8, &amp;tf_1A); // typeid (A *)
__pointer_type_info tf_PP1A (&quot;PP1A&quot;, 0, &amp;tf_P1A); // typeid (A **)
