Well, funny I did not find it the first time. A typo in the &quot;find&quot; box, I guess.
Sorry.

</I>&gt;<i> what it decided.  At this point, the decision is not, quite frankly,
</I>&gt;<i> written in a form that anyone not on the committee is likely to
</I>&gt;<i> decipher.  (Well, at least I've tried hard, I'm not an idiot, I know
</I>&gt;<i> about this application domain, and I still can't figure it out.)
</I>
I understand your remarks, and they are perfectly valid. I was trying to clarify
on your example. That's probably the wrong approach, though, since what you want
is a clear enough wording in the writeup. So let me go through the writeup and
see if I can improve things slightly, based on your comments.

Now, Jim, I just realized that for some reason, in the writeup, the vcall
offsets are restricted for &quot;virtual bases&quot; cases. I am unable to implement the
&quot;single adjusting entry point&quot; optimization if this is the case. I fixed it in
the attached writeup, but I may be wrong.

Jason's writeup to B-1 says that you have to implement the vcall offsets even if
you don't use them. I don't think we agreed to get rid of them (or is this
something else important I missed?)


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; - If there is a virtual base along this path, let `V' be the
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; virtual base nearest to `C' along the path.  (In fact, `V' will
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; be `C' itself if `C' is a virtual base.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Christophe&gt; You are considering a path between B and C, so V would
</I>&gt;<i>     Christophe&gt; be the closest between B and C. In which case I do not
</I>&gt;<i>     Christophe&gt; understand the adjustment below (&quot;Adjustment from 'A'
</I>&gt;<i>     Christophe&gt; to 'V'&quot;). Either you are considering that V is between
</I>&gt;<i>     Christophe&gt; A and C, in which case you need to adjust from A to V,
</I>&gt;<i>     Christophe&gt; or you are considering that V is between C and B, in
</I>&gt;<i>     Christophe&gt; which case if you see it at call site, you would have
</I>&gt;<i>     Christophe&gt; to adjust from B to V. Did I misunderstand?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You won't in general see `V' at the call site, if it's between C and
</I>&gt;<i> B, because you might have `A*' when you're making the call.  (If you
</I>&gt;<i> had a `B*', or a `C*', then `C::f' would be the unique final overrider
</I>&gt;<i> -- by hypothesis -- so you would have converted your pointer to a
</I>&gt;<i> `C*', and you be looking at the C-in-B vtable, rather than the A-in-B
</I>&gt;<i> vtable, which is what my discussion was talking about.)
</I>
Violent agreement, apparently. So I must have misunderstood what you wrote. It
was unclear to me that you were discussing only the A-in-B vtable case.


&gt;<i> I'm not sure where you're supposed to adjust `A' to.  That's what I'm
</I>&gt;<i> trying to find out.  It may not be the V that I suggested -- I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> sure.  I'm hoping that my words could serve as the model for whatever
</I>&gt;<i> the right answer is.  They're in the form of an algorithm that
</I>&gt;<i> explains exactly what to put in the vtable, in the general case, and
</I>&gt;<i> that's a good thing, since that's what an implementor needs to know.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Christophe&gt; So, starting with your example again. Sorry for the
</I>&gt;<i>     Christophe&gt; verbiage...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Christophe&gt; Case 1 is: V is between A and C.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> THere's no discussion of these two different cases in the current
</I>&gt;<i> writeup.  So, I'm already lost.  What you write below seems reasonably
</I>&gt;<i> logical -- but I'm not sure it's the same thing as in the document.
</I>
The two cases were because I was trying to reconstruct the possible layouts from
what you said. I saw two cases, there was a third one (your pictogram below)
that I did not even see... These cases are not distinct in the writeup.


&gt;<i> In general, &quot;between A and C&quot; doesn't make sense; they may be
</I>&gt;<i> unrelated. The picture I had in mind was:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>               B
</I>&gt;<i>              / \
</I>&gt;<i>             A   C
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, B is the most derived class, C contains the final
</I>&gt;<i> overrider, we're looking at the vtable for A.  That's the general case
</I>&gt;<i> -- all other cases are special instances of this one.  But, I guess
</I>&gt;<i> for case 1, we're assuming C is derived from A?
</I>
I thought this was your intent. Since again I have some trouble reconstructing
what you want (unless there is some additional base common to A and C where f is
first declared???)

The best would be for you to write the code for the case that annoys you.


&gt;<i>     Christophe&gt; - If you call through an A*, you call through the A
</I>&gt;<i>     Christophe&gt; vtable, which points to a virtual-base-adjustment
</I>&gt;<i>     Christophe&gt; thunk. That thunk reads the C-to-A virtual base
</I>&gt;<i>     Christophe&gt; offset, and adds that to get a C*, and then jumps to
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Where is this offset?  There's a vbase offset in C for converting to
</I>&gt;<i> A, if A is a virtual base of C.  But, there's no virtual base offset
</I>&gt;<i> in A, for converting to a C.  Where's V in all this?
</I>
I prefer not to add confusion until I see the code you have in mind.

Christophe
