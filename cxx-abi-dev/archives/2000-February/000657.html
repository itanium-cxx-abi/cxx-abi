In the case of diamond inheritance, we give up that approach and use your vcall
offsets. So I hope the problem does not exist.


&gt;<i> even if there is, it would be much more complex than the one
</I>&gt;<i> for the current design.  This is why I don't think the change could be made

</I>
The tweaking of a few words I wanted was the following:

1/ Remove the restriction that vcall offsets be allocated only in the presence
of virtual inheritance. Instead, mandate them for virtual or multiple
inheritance.

2/ Change the allocation of vcall offsets so that:
- we allocate one per class when there is no virtual inheritance
- we allocate one per function as soon as there is virtual inheritance.

3/ Discuss how we allocate them (both cases are currently quite unclear, in my
opinion, so we needed to do that anyway.)

Christophe
