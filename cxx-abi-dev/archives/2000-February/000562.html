<PRE>I'd like to continue working through the table location issues, as
we've started in email and at the last meeting.  But first, I think
my concern has been misinterpreted, so I'd like to clarify that.

---

I don't have an immediate objection to the locations identified for
the tables by HP, except possibly sharing Jason's question about
whether another type table location would better allow sharing it
among multiple text segments.  I would guess that we'll end up
agreeing to put the tables where HP does (except, again, possibly
the type table) for IA-64.

However, I also believe in maximizing flexibility and generality,
at least when it's nearly free, and particularly when there are
anticipatable uses for it.  Now, I can anticipate two departures
from HP's assumptions that are relevant here:

  - Multiple text segments.  This is common in the embedded world,
    where the reasons for them often also prevent their being adjacent
    in the address, and probably also sometimes prevent the inclusion
    of extraneous data with each text segment.

  - LSDA somewhere besides the associated .text segment.  See the
    above, or imagine a language/implementation that decides to put a
    lot of runtime-relocated data in it.

These possibilities, even though I don't anticipate them for IA-64
mainstream C++, lead me to ask the question:  Can we provide the
flexibility to support them at little or no cost to our own needs?

---

With this in mind, what are the requirements?  We have four structures
of interest:

 1) The original entry to the complex is via an IP value, i.e. an
    address in .text (probably).  The unwind library, which is part of
    the implementation and therefore can be coordinated with other
    system components like ld.so, needs to map this IP value to the
    associated .text segment start address and to its associated
    .unwind segment address and size, which it uses to find an unwind
    table entry.

    So, we need under-the-covers maps from IP -&gt; .text -&gt; .unwind .

 2) The unwind table entry identifies a text fragment, using
    offsets relative to the .text segment, which it should know from
    step (1).  It also identifies an unwind info record, currently as
    an offset relative to the .text segment.  This still happens in the
    unwind library.

    So, we add an under-the-covers map from .unwind -&gt; .unwind_info .

 3) The unwind info table contains unwind descriptor references
    relative to the text fragment, handled in the unwind library,
    and the LSDA, handled by the personality routine.  The latter
    includes:

    ** LPStart, an offset currently relative to its own location,
    which requires that unwind info be in the associated text segment.

    ** TTBase, an offset currently relative to its own location,
    which requires that the type table be in the unwind info segment.

    Other references to call sites and landing pads, as offsets
    relative to the address calculated from LPStart.

 4) The type table contains RTTI references, relative to GP for the
    current text fragment, handled by the personality routine.
    
    ** This requires that the RTTI be in the data segment containing
    GP, and prevents address-only RTTI comparisons, since it does not
    support preemption.

The potentially problematic references are those with (**), which make
assumptions about the locations of tables AND are handled by the
personality routine above-the-covers.  (The under-the-covers mappings
can use unspecified collaboration between the system and unwind
library.)

The unwind info references could be &quot;fixed&quot; by making them relative to
segment addresses identified by the unwind library (more
under-the-covers mappings) and passed to the personality routine, e.g.
via routines like _Unwind_GetIP.

The type table requirement that RTTI be in the segment with GP could be
fixed in the same way; the inability to deal with address-only
comparisons cannot.

Finally, although the under-the-covers mappings need not be our
official concern, I note that the relevant information is known to the
static linker (except perhaps .unwind_info location), and providing an
explicit way to pass it from linker to unwind library might simplify
the latter and make it more portable.

Anyway, I hope this clarifies things somewhat.  It leads me to believe
that pursuing this can produce simple elimination of the current
restrictions.

Comments?
