<PRE>I believe in its current state, with my initial proposal for alternate entry
points scrapped, I think the answer is yes (at least from my point of view).

First, my proposal and Jason's are not opposed. Jason solved a case in virtual
inheritance that I had overlooked, by introducing vcall offsets. So vcall
offsets allow a same &quot;thunk&quot; to be shared between multiple subobjects in a class
that has a virtual base.

My proposal applies to the non-virtual multiple inheritance case, and allows a
same thunk to be shared between multiple subobjects in a class that has no
virtual base, as long as by the derived classes of that class, as long as they
do not override the virtual function and do not themselves have virtual
inheritance.


In the absence of the &quot;adjusting entry points&quot; I proposed, you have to use
thunks. Within a same class, of course, you can use the 'AddAddAdd' scheme,
since you know the different offsets at compile time for the various subobjects
that compose the class. However, a derived class cannot share this, because its
vtable may very well be emitted in a different .o. For instance, consider:

	struct A { virtual a(); int aa; };
	struct B { virtual b(); int bb; };
	struct C { virtual c(); int cc; };

	struct D : A, B { virtual b(); int dd; }
	struct E : D { /* Does not override b() */ }

The primary vtable for D points to D::b, no adjustment required. The secondary
vtable for B in D points to D::b with, say, an 'Add' adjustment, which would be
of -16 (from the B* to the D*).

When you emit the vtable for E, the good news is that the adjustment is the same
(-16 from B* to D*). The bad news is that you don't know how to locate the thunk
that adds -16 (unless we all agree on the algorithm for emitting this kind of
&quot;AddAddAdd&quot; thunk, which we did not.) Since there is no relocation that says
something like &quot;Copy contents of the D vtable at offset X&quot;, there is no way to
build the vtable for E from a different translation unit so that is reuses the
'Add' thunk. So you end up emitting a real thunk. I believe I demonstrated in
another e-mail that these &quot;real&quot; thunks are bad for performance. They also cost
a lot of space (16 bytes per thunk at least). 


I also believe the problem gets only worse in the presence of shared libraries.
We said that we would preload the GP from the call site. So now the E vtable
entry for d() naively contains D's GP, but an E thunk. That E thunk needs to
branch to another load module. We are out of luck: the data to branch to that
other module (the function descriptor) is GP-relative, I believe, but relative
to D's GP. So the E vtable entry really needs to contain the GP for E, which
means that there is just no benefit in having the GP in the vtable. The E thunk
itself also needs to pay the full penalty of loading a GP and doing an indirect
branch. And I could not write it in less than 64 bytes.



So my proposal is simply that, for the non-virtual multiple inheritance case, we
have a this-pointer adjustment offset in each secondary vtable, that adjusts
form the secondary vtable class to the function's target class.

The algorithm I proposed to allocate these offsets was the following:

- While defining class C, we allocate a single offset &quot;convert_to_C&quot;, that
converts from the class of the seconday vtable in which it is stored to the C
class.

- The convert_to_C in the C primary vtable is theoretically present, but its
value is zero, so it may be omitted.

- For all other classes, the offset of 'convert_to_C' relative to the secondary
vptr is constant. A naive algorithm to ensure that is that this offset is the
first negative offset not used by a 'convert_to_X' in any of the bases. I
acknoledge this generally may padding in the vtables, but I did not see a better
way to do it, short of using a double indirection.

This 'convert_to_C' is used by an adjusting entry point emitted immediatly prior
to the main, non-adjusting entry point, which computes this += convert_to_C. If
I use this secondary entry point at all, I know that the final overrider is
C::f, and that the call was in the form bptr-&gt;f(), where bptr is a non-primary
non-virtual base of C.

The same 'convert_to_C' value is shared by different virtual functions overriden
in C, no matter from which base they are overriden (the interesting case, of
course, being when they are overriden from multiple bases). The reason is that
if C::f override B::f, the delta is the same than if C::g overrides B::g. It may
be different than the delta between C::g and B2::g, but then I am using B2's
secondary vtable, which contains the B2-&gt;C conversion.


This scheme has the following benefits:

- For each virtual function, you emit a secondary entry point with a known size.
The best possible size is 48 bytes, unless some magic predication thingie I did
not think of can reduce that. No matter how many secondary vbases or how many
derived classes reuse that function, the size is 48.

- For each secondary base, you add 8 (or more if padding) bytes to the table.

- This scheme works accross shared libraries, since the thunk used is always
&quot;tied&quot; to the function.


I hope I clarified...

Best regards
Christophe
