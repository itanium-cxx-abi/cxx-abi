<PRE>
It seems that I finally understand Jason's proposal, i.e., the
currently accepted resolution.  I managed to write up the following
description, which, when run by Jason, came back with only minor
tweaks -- no major corrections.  That indicates I've probably got it,
now.

I hope that having a (relatively) clear writeup will help.

Thanks to all of you for helping.

Purpose
=======

The purpose of this document is to explain, at a high level, what
information must be present in the vtable for a class A which declares
a virtual function f in order that, given an pointer of type A*, the
caller can call the virtual function f.  This document does not
specify exactly where that information is located, nor does it specify
how to convert a pointer to a class derived from A to an A*, if that
is required.  In addition, this document provides the rationale behind
these design decisions, together with suggestions for implementing the
ABI in order to achieve maximum efficiency.

When this document uses the term &quot;function pointer&quot; it is understood
that this term may refer either to a traditional function pointer
(i.e., a pointer to a GP/address pair) or a GP/address pair itself.
Which of these alternatives will actually be used must be specified by
the ABI, but is not specified in this document.

Throughout, we assume that A is the class for which we are creating a
vtable, B is the most derived class in the hierarchy, and C is the
class that contains C::f, the unique final overrider for A.  This
document specifies the contents of the f entry in the A-in-B vtable.
(If A is primary base in the hierarchy, then the A-in-B vtable will be
shared with the derived class vtable -- but the contents of the A
portion of that vtable will still be as specified here.)

In all cases, the &quot;non-adjusting entry point&quot; for a virtual function
expects the `this' pointer to point to an instance of the class in
which the virtual function is defined.  In other words, the
non-adjusting entry point for C::f will expect that its `this'
pointer points to a C object.

We say that a subobject X is a &quot;morally virtual&quot; base of Y if X is an
indirect or direct base class of Y, and if X is either a virtual base
of Y, or the direct or indirect base of a virtual base of Y.

A's Vtable
==========

Case 1: A = C

  (In this case, we are creating either the primary vtable for A, or
  the A-in-B secondary vtable.)

  The vtable contains a function pointer pointing to the non-adjusting
  entry point for A::f.

Case 2: A != C

  In this case, we are creating the A-in-B secondary vtable.

  The vtable contains a pointer to an entry point that performs the
  adjustment from an A* to a C*, and then transfers control to the
  non-adjusting entry point for C::f.

Callee
======

For each direct or indirect base A of C that is not a morally virtual
base of C, the compiler must emit, in the same object file as the code
for C::f, an &quot;A adjusting entry point&quot; for C::f.  This entry point
will expect that its `this' pointer points to an A*, and will
convert it to a C* before transferring control to the non-adjusting
entry point for C::f.

For each direct or indirect virtual base V of C such that either V
declares f, or is derived from a class that declares f, the compiler
must emit, in the same object file as the code for C::f, an &quot;V
adjusting entry point&quot; for C::f.  This entry point will expect that
its `this' pointer points to the unique virtual V subobject of C.
(Note that there may in general be multiple V subobjects of C, but
that only one of them will be virtual.)  This entry point must examine
the V vtable given by its this point, extract the vcall offset
corresponding to f located in that vtable, and add this offset to the
this pointer.  (Note that, as specified in the data layout document,
when V is used as a virtual base, its vtable contains vcall offsets
for every virtual function declared in V or any of its bases.)  Then,
this entry point must transfer control to the non-adjusting entry
point.

For each morally virtual base M of C such that M is *not* a virtual
base, and such that M declares f, the compiler must emit, in the same
object file as the code for C::f, an &quot;M adjusting entry point&quot; for
C::f.  This entry point will expect that its `this' pointer points to
an A*, and will convert it to a V*, where V is the nearest virtual
base to M along the path from C to M.  Then, it will convert the V* to
a C* by using the vcall offset stored in the V's vtable.  (Note that
one implementation of the &quot;M adjusting entry point&quot; is to convert from
M* to V* and then transfer control to the &quot;V adjusting entry point.&quot;)

Caller
======

When calling a virtual function f, through a pointer of static type
B*, the caller

  - Selects a (possibly improper) subobject A of B such that A
    declares f.  (In general, A may be the same as B.)  (Note that A
    need not define f; it may contain either a definition of f, or a
    declaration of f as a pure virtual function.)

  - Converts the B* to point to this subobject.  (Call the resulting
    pointer `a'.)

  - Uses the vtable pointer contained in the A subobject to locate
    the function pointer through which to perform the call.

  - Calls through this function pointer, passing `a' as the `this' 
    pointer.

(Note that in general it will be optimal to select the class which
contained the final overrider (i.e., C) as the class to which the B*
should be converted.  This class is always a satisfactory choice,
since it is known to contain a definition of f.  In addition, if the
dynamic type of the object is B, then C::f will be the function
ultimately selected by the call, which means that C's vtable will
contain a pointer to the non-adjusting entry point, meaning that no
additional adjustments to the `this' pointer will be required.

However, there may be cases in which choosing a different base
subobject could be superior.  For example, if there is an alternate
base D which also declares f, and a pointer to the D subobject is
already available, then it may be better to use the D subobject rather
than converting the B* to a C*, in order to avoid the cost of the
conversion.)

Implementation Notes
====================

The design specified here provides several benefits:

- In the case of single, non-virtual inheritance, calling a virtual
  function requires no adjustment to the `this' pointer, and no vcall
  offsets.  This is in keeping with the guiding principle that &quot;you
  shouldn't pay for features you don't use.&quot;

- If the static type of an object is the same as its dynamic type,
  then no adjustment to the `this' pointer is required.

- All thunks can be emitted in the same translation unit as the
  overriding function.

- Thunks from classes that are not morally virtual bases do not
  require a branch to the non-adjusting entry point.

  We suggest the following implementation:

    m2: /* Thunk for morally virtual base M2.  */
        this += offsetof (V, M1) - offsetof (V, M2)
    m1: /* Thunk for morally virtual base M1.  */
        this -= offsetof (V, M1)
    v:  /* Thunk for virtual base V.  */
        this += vcall offset stored in V vtable
	goto f;
    a2: /* Thunk for non-virtual base A2.  */
        this += offsetof (B, A1) - offsetof (B, A2)
        /* Fall through.  */
    a1: /* Thunk for non-virtual base A1.  */
        this += offsetof (B, C) - offsetof (B, A1)
        /* Fall through.  */
    f:  /* Non-adjusting entry point.  */

  (Here `offsetof' is a compile-time computable function that gives
  the offset of its second parameter in its first parameter.)

  (Alternatively the `v' entry point above could be of the form:

    v: /* Thunk for virtual base V.  */
       this += vcall offset stored in V vtable 
               - offsetof (B, C) + offsetof (B, A2)
       /* Fall through.  */
   
   which alternative is better depends on how many adds follow at this
   point.  In general, if many adds remain before the non-adjusting
   entry point, it may be better to suffer the consequences of the
   indirect branch.)

  In this way, a virtual call through a base A1, A2, etc., that is not
  a virtual base of C (or a direct or indirect base of a virtual base
  of C), does not require an additional branch, and is therefore more
  likely to avoid icache misses.  Even the thunk for V may avoid
  severe icache penalties since it is located near the non-adjusting
  entry point for f.  Furthermore, if there are no non-virtual bases,
  then the sequence can become just:

    v: /* Thunk for virtual base V.  */
       this += vcall offset stored in V vtable
    f: /* Non-adjusting entry point.  */

Open Issues
===========

We should specify manglings for each of the thunks so that other
translation units can use them.
