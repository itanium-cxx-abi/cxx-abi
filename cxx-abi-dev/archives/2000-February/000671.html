    Jim&gt; I've added new issues A-26/27 for the representation of NULL
    Jim&gt; pointers to members.  But I have a couple of questions:

    Jim&gt; -- For a pointer to member function, if the function is
    Jim&gt; non-virtual, it doesn't seem that one ever needs to worry
    Jim&gt; about the adjustments.  If it's the same target function
    Jim&gt; address, the only significance of the adjustment is how much
    Jim&gt; you modify this before calling it, which is a property of the
    Jim&gt; containing class rather than of the target.

You still need to know whether or not the adjustment is guaranteed or
not -- if it is, then you have to make sure to keep it zero, and if it
isn't then you have to generate more complex code when doing
comparisions.

    Jim&gt; -- But if the function is virtual, the &quot;pointer&quot; is an offset
    Jim&gt; into the vtable, and if you really want to identify whether
    Jim&gt; the ultimate function is the same it gets really messy,
    Jim&gt; especially if you need to pass through &quot;thunks&quot; first.  Is
    Jim&gt; this the semantics, or is it much simpler for some reason?

Ooh, ugh.  But in [expr.eq] we have:

  Otherwise  if either is a pointer to a virtual member func-
  tion, the result is unspecified.

so, we can do what we wish.

    Jim&gt; -- For a pointer to member data, Jason had me convinced that
    Jim&gt; the displacement would never go negative because the bases
    Jim&gt; are allocated before additional data members in the derived
    Jim&gt; class, until I thought about virtual bases, where that's no
    Jim&gt; longer true.  Is there a C++ restriction that makes this not
    Jim&gt; a problem, or...?

I think I submitted a &quot;proof&quot; of the non-negativity of
pointers-to-members in all cases.  I believe that you can't cast a
D::* to a B::* if B is a virtual base.
