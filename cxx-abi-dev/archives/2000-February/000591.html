I did understand what you want. What I did not understand is why. This has a
non-zero cost (see below), and I don't see anything you can do with that that
you can't do with the current scheme.


&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The key problem I see is the following: to get the unwind address from the
function address, all you need today is a mechanism that, from the IP, gets the
text segment, which is fairly trivial. Then everything is relative to the text
segment.

However, two identical IP addresses may _not_ correspond to the same GP under
the current ABI (consider two instances of a same shared lib). In other words,
if you want to recover a GP from the IP, you need some magic. The magic we do
currently is that you go to the unwind info block, which contains unwind records
indicating where the GP was saved, and you recover it. That's the value that we
ultimately get from Unwind_GetGR(GP). The process that led to GP did not require
any dld support beyond the IP-&gt;text segment translation. Everything after that
is made of self-relative or text-relative offsets.

If the unwind info block is to be placed in a different segment, then you need a
_writable_ pointer to point to that segment (since the segment address is
allocated by the dynamic loader, whether text or data). So the unwind table (or
part of it) has to go to writable data, and become GP-relative. Then, some
really black magic has to occur to make sure that we can recover the initial GP
we need for unwinding. This black magic also needs to have debugger support,
etc, etc.

Also, this whole process becomes also a lot more fragile, since it starts at a
writable pointer, so a corruption of this pointer prevents any unwinding from
happening.

Last, but not least, I can't imagine going to our dld, linker, debugger, backend
and ABI folks and tell them: you need to change the location of the unwind info
block (or unwind table) without a very good reason. Remember that the location
of the unwind tables and unwind info block, and their format, are part of what
we call the C ABI, not the C++ ABI.
