<PRE>                      Notes from 10 Feb meeting

                              NEW ISSUES

&gt;<i>From HP:
</I>HP will be supporting an ilp32 model as well as as an lp64 model.
The ABI only discusses an lp64 model.  Do we want to support ilp32
in any way?  What will we have to do to support (a) compatibility
between different vendors' ipl32 compilers (b) compatibility between
ilp32 and lp64.  HP has suggested, for example, modifying the mangling
scheme so that long long in ipl32 is mangled the same way as long in
lp64.  Is this enough to ensure ipl32/lp64 link compatibility, or
would we need to make many other changes as well?

&gt;<i>From Cygnus:
</I>Users have access to types' mangled names via the standard type_info
class.  Users may sometimes want to get demangled names.  Should
we provide an entry point for calling a demangler?  This might be
a standalone function, perhaps with an interface like that of EDG's
demangle(), or it might be some kind of type_info extension.  If we
do this, should we attempt to specify exactly what demangled names
look like, or should we explicitly leave it unspecified and warn users
not to depend on the exact format?

                             ACTION ITEMS

Christophe - Find out whether the base ABI nails down the sizes of all
basic floating point types.  (Is long double always required to be 80
bits?)  If not, we may have some issues here.

Christophe - Write up a proposal for using incomplete_type_info
rather than using the comdat proxy method.  (See A24 discussion
below.)

Matt - Write up detailed wording for Issue A21 Proposal C.

Daveed - Update mangling document based on today's discussion.

Coleen - Finish construction vtable writeup.

                               MANGLING

We have agreed that local statics and local classes must be mangled.
We agreed that string literals should also be mangled even if linker
features might make it unnecessary.  The motivation is a desire to
support less capable linkers on other platforms.

For local statics and local classes, the mangled name consists of the
mangled function name, a sequence number, and the name of the local
class/varaible.  For string literals the mangled name consists only of
the mangled function name and the sequence number.

(There was concern that this might prevent merging of identical string
literals.  Jason believes it doesn't, that given a smart linker it
will just result in multiple names for the same string literal.)

Sequence numbers are assigned in lexical order within a function,
starting at 1.  The entities that receive sequence numbers are local
static variables, local classes, and string literals.  Other entities
(e.g. automatic variables) do not receive or affect sequence numbers.

Exception specification information must be part of the mangled name
of a function.

Special entities that need to receive mangled names, in addition to those
mentioned in Daveed's document:

 - Vtables (which should contain mangled name of complete type)
 - Construction vtables probably do not require mangled names, and
   table of vtables probably doesn't either.  Daveed will reserve
   prefixes for them just in case.
 - If we are using the comdat proxy method for class typeinfos,
   then both class typeinfo objects and the comdat proxies must be
   given mangled names.  We must ensure that the comdat proxy for
   an incomplete class is the same as the one for a complete class
   with the same name, and we must ensure that the typeinfo object
   for an incomplete class is different from that of any complete
   class.  (Either that, or make all typeinfo objects for incomplete
   classes static.)

Exported template may require other things to be mangled.  We don't
have a detailed analysis.

We discussed the idea of having a small dictionary of well known
names, so that mangled names could be shorter.  Jason was concerned
with readability of mangled names if we had too many things in this
dictionary, and Daveed was concerned that a large dictionary wouldn't
give enough of a space savings because an index would take too many
bits.  If we have such a dictionary it will have very few names in
it.  Some obvious candidates are
  std
  std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;
  std::allocator&lt;char&gt;
  std::basic_string&lt;char, char_traits&lt;char&gt;, std::allocator&lt;char&gt; &gt;


                        RTTI - A23 AND GENERAL

Minor corrections to RTTI discussion in data layout document:
In section 7c, which describes the vmi_flags, flag 0x01 is
documented incorrectly.  It says &quot;class has non-diamond multiple
inheritance&quot;, which isn't quite right.  We're really talking
more about repeated inheritance: having multiple subobjects of
the same type.

Also in vmi_flags, Jason questions whether flags 0x04 and 0x08 are
necessary.  What do we really need &quot;has virtual base(s)&quot; and &quot;has
non-virtual base(s)&quot; for?  Jason has sent email to Nathan about
this.

Naming issue: we decided to put all of our type_info subclasses
in namespace abi, not namespace std.  This means, of course,
that they can't go in any of the standard headers.  Rather than
inventing multiple header names, we would like to put everything
(unwinding longjmp, type_info subclasses, etc.) into one quasi-
standard header.  We propose the name &lt;ia64cxxabi&gt;.  Everything
in that header will be in namespace abi.

Issue A23 can almost be closed.  The only thing we need to
resolve is whether to keep the two flags that Jason is unsure about.

                              RTTI - A24

The scheme we have been converging on: we extend __class_type_info
by putting in a new field, id_proxy_ptr, of type char*.  It points
to a one-byte comdat which serves only as a unique address.  (We
don't see a strong need to ask the base ABI group to mandate a
magic unique-address feature in the linker.  We may want to get input
from our linker people, though.)

A class's __class_type_info object and its comdat proxy both receive
mangled names.  We must make sure that the proxy's mangled name is the
same for all complete and incomplete declarations of a class, that the
mangled name of the __class_type_info object is the same for all
complete declarations of a class, and that the mangled name of the
__class_type_info object is different for incomplete declarations than
for complete declarations.  One way to achieve this is to make
__class_type_info objects for incomplete declarations static.

We add a new flag to __pointer_type_info; let's say bit 0x4.  If
this is set, it means we have a pointer to an incomplete type (or
pointer to pointer to incomplete type, etc.)

We compare two __class_type_infos for equality by pointer comparison
of the id_proxy_ptr fields.  We compare two __pointer_type_infos for
equality by looking at the addresses of the type_info objects,
*unless* the incomplete bit is set in at least one of them.  If the
incomplete bit is set, we have to compare the pointed-to types.  For
everything other than classes and pointers we can just use address
equality of the type_info objects themselves.

In response to Jason's 000129 question: we can't use gp-relative
references for type_info objects because we're only using comdat
proxies for __class_type_info, not for other kinds of type_info
objects.

In response to Nathan's 000130 question: this is the reason to
give the complete and incomplete __class_type_info objects different
mangled names.  That way a complete __class_type_info object in a
DSO won't be overridden by an incomplete __class_type_info object
in the executable.

At the very end of this meeting we got a suggestion from Christophe
for a complete different mechanism.  We agreed that we can't evaluate
it without a writeup.  The suggestion: abandon these comdat proxies
altogether.  Instead we have a new type_info class,
__incomplete_class_type_info.  Comparisons involving two
__class_type_info objects use address equality, comparisons involving
two __incomplete_class_type_info objects, or a __class_type_info and
an __incomplete_class_type_info, do string comparison on the name.  We
still would have an incomplete bit in the __pointer_type_info class,
which, again, we would use to determine whether two
__pointer_type_info objects with different addresses might
nevertheless represent the same pointer type.

                       ARRAY OPERATOR NEW - A21

We agreed that Proposal B, where ::operator new(size_t, void*) is
a special case with no cookie, is preferable to Proposal A, where
all versions of array new get cookies.

We also agreed to the variation where we don't reserve space for a
cookie if the type has no destructor.  We're calling it Proposal C.
We need a writeup, but we should be able to close this issue next
week.
