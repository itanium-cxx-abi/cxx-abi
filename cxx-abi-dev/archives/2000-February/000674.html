OK, I got ambitious (foolish? reckless?) and went searching through the
Standard for pointers to members.  Here's what I found:

- There is a standard conversion (4.11) from A::* to B::* (same type)
  if B is derived from A, and A is not an inaccessible, ambiguous, or
  virtual base of B.

- There is a static cast (5.2.9) from B::* to A::* if the opposite
  standard conversion exists.  Note that this still excludes crossing
  the virtual base boundary.  The pointee member need not be in the
  target class, but must be in one of the classes derived from it.

- There is a reinterpret cast (5.2.10), but the only requirements are
  that NULL becomes NULL, and it is invertible.

- Comparisons (5.10) of pointers to virtual member functions are undefined.

So, conclusions:

- Since we always allocate non-virtual bases before data members,
  any base object in a derivation chain will have its base address
  smaller than any of the data members declared in members of the
  chain.  Therefore, the offset represented by a pointer-to-data-member
  will always be non-negative, even after the permitted conversions
  above.

  So, we could either use -1 for NULL, or use 0 and increment the
  offset.  0x800...000 is an unnecessary complication.

- For pointer-to-function-member comparisons, we only need to worry
  about non-virtual members and null.  Since the representation
  stores the actual address of the function descriptor, we should be
  able to just compare the pointers, and ignore the adjustment.

  For conversions between base classes, it seems that we need only
  modify the adjustment, and then only if one is not primary for the
  other.  For conversion to null, it seems that we need only set the
  pointer to 0, and can ignore the adjustment.

This seems simple enough.  So I must be missing something :-).
