Mark, I did not find anything containing &quot;Virtual Function Calling Convention&quot;
in the documentation. Could you specify an URL and quote the original text, it
would help me locating it...


&gt;<i>  Here's an attempted rewrite.

</I>&gt;<i>     is used for `f' in the `A-in-B' secondary vtable.  Here is the
</I>&gt;<i>     algorithm:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     - Find any path from `B' to `C' in the inheritance graph for `B'.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     - If there is no virtual base along the path, then create
</I>&gt;<i>       an entry point which adjusts the `this' pointer from `A' to `C'.

</I>
Yes. What's more, in that case, the offset is stored in the vtable at a
(possibly large) constant negative offset from the vptr. We called this offset
'convert_to_C', and it is used only when the final overrider is a C. The A-in-B
vtable contains a 'convert_to_C' value that converts from an A* to a C*. The
benefits are explained in
<A HREF="http://reality.sgi.com/dehnert_engr/cxx/cxx-closed.html,">http://reality.sgi.com/dehnert_engr/cxx/cxx-closed.html,</A> section B-1.


&gt;<i>     - If there is a virtual base along this path, let `V' be the
</I>&gt;<i>       virtual base nearest to `C' along the path.  (In fact, `V'
</I>&gt;<i>       will be `C' itself if `C' is a virtual base.)
</I>
You are considering a path between B and C, so V would be the closest between B
and C. In which case I do not understand the adjustment below (&quot;Adjustment from
'A' to 'V'&quot;). Either you are considering that V is between A and C, in which
case you need to adjust from A to V, or you are considering that V is between C
and B, in which case if you see it at call site, you would have to adjust from B
to V. Did I misunderstand?


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>       (Note that the choice of `V' is independent of the choice of path.
</I>&gt;<i>       If there was more than one path, then there must have been a
</I>&gt;<i>       virtual base along all of the paths, and there is a unique one
</I>&gt;<i>       closest to `C'.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>       Now, create an entry point which first performs the adjustment
</I>&gt;<i>       from `A' to `V'.  (This value can be computed statically, when
</I>&gt;<i>       the `A-in-B' vtable is created.)  Then, adjust the `this'
</I>&gt;<i>       pointer by the vcall offset stored in the secondary vtable for
</I>&gt;<i>       `V' (i.e., the `V-in-B' vtable).  (This adjustment will adjust
</I>&gt;<i>       the `this' pointer from `V' to `C'.)  Finally, transfer control
</I>&gt;<i>       to the non-adjusting entry point for `C::f'.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Is that correct?
</I>
Maybe, but I'm not sure I understood... :-)


So, starting with your example again. Sorry for the verbiage...

Case 1 is: V is between A and C.

- If you call through an A*, you call through the A vtable, which points to a
virtual-base-adjustment thunk. That thunk reads the C-to-A virtual base offset,
and adds that to get a C*, and then jumps to the non-adjusting C::f. Of course,
the C-to-A virtual base offset is not necessarily constant along the class
hierarchy, so for instance the C-to-A virtual base offset in a C is not the same
as the C-to-A virtual base offset in a B.

- If you call through a C*, you call through the C vtable. In that case, you
don't care if A is a virtual base, since C::f expects a C*. Virtual-base
adjustment to A, if necessary, would be done inside C::f. So the C vtable points
to the non-adjusting entry point.

- If you call through a B*, you call through the C vtable (the final overrider
for f), and you adjust to a C* statically.


Case 2: V is between C and B:

- If you call through an A*, you call through the A vtable. The offset from A to
C is constant in the class hierarchy, but there may be multiple bases A1, A2,
A3, with different offsets. The &quot;classical&quot; approach is to use multiple thunks
that convert from A1 to C, from A2 to C, from A3 to C. Because of the high cache
muss and branch misprediction penalty, I proposed that we rather have all
vtables A1-in-C, A2-in-C, ... contain an offset, call it 'Convert_to_C', that
adjusts from A1 to C, A2 to C, etc. This way, there can be a single adjusting
entry point that does this adjustment (although you can still emit thunks)

- If you call through a C*, you call through the C vtable, which points to the
non-adjusting entry point C::f.

- If you call through a B*, you need at call-site to convert from B* to C*,
which involves a dynamic adjustment using the B-to-V virtual base offsets in B's
vtable, followed by a static adjustment from V to C (which is known at
compile-time).


I'm not sure I clarified anything ;-)



&gt;<i>   It seems like the scheme specified in the ABI is advantageous in a
</I>&gt;<i> situation where `C' is the same as `A', and `A' is the same as `V'.
</I>&gt;<i> (In other words, if `A' is a virtual base and `A::f' is not overriden
</I>&gt;<i> in `B'.)  Then, by emitting the vcall-adjusting entry point right
</I>&gt;<i> before the main entry point for `C::f', calling `f' requires only one
</I>&gt;<i> branch (to the entry point specified in the vtable), rather than two
</I>&gt;<i> (to a thunk, and then from the thunk to the main function).  Right?
</I>
First, note that the scheme is believed to be advantageous whenever there is no
virtual inheritance, which I think is a frequent case. Cache locality plays a
big role here.

Second, in the virtual base case, there is no guarantee that the thunk will be
right before the non-adjusting entry point: as Jason pointed out, you cannot
find a single offset to use to perform the adjustment.

Third, I do not understand in this statement whether you are calling through an
A*, B* or C*.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   I still can't see why it is a win to use vcall offsets in the case
</I>&gt;<i> where `A' and `V' are not the same class.  You already have to do one
</I>&gt;<i> static adjustment in the entry point -- why not just adjust all the
</I>&gt;<i> way to `B' directly, without bothering to look up the vcall offset?
</I>
I did not understand this question :-( If you feel a static thunk is better than
a dynamic lookup, then you can emit that thunk and point to it through the
vtable, as Jason pointed out. The ABI allows you to do that.


&gt;<i>   Furthermore, the actual algorithm used to perform the adjustments
</I>&gt;<i> does not seem necessarily to be part of the ABI.  The layout of the
</I>&gt;<i> vtables is certainly part of the ABI.  But, if one compiler wants to
</I>&gt;<i> completely ignore the vcall offset entries in the vtables, and compute
</I>&gt;<i> the entire adjustment statically, shouldn't that be permitted by the
</I>&gt;<i> ABI, even though it might require one extra branch?  Surely that's
</I>&gt;<i> just a quality-of-implementation issue?
</I>
Correct. Again, that seems clear to me from Jason's writeup:


Note that the ABI only specifies the multiple entry points; how those entry
points are provided is unspecified. An existing compiler which uses thunks could
be converted to use this ABI by only adding support for the vcall offsets. A
more efficient implementation would be to emit all of the thunks immediately
before the non-adjusting entry point to the function. Another might use
predication rather than branches to reach the main function. Another might emit
a new copy of the function for each entry point; this is a quality of
implementation issue.
