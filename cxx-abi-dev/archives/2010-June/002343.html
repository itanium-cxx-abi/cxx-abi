<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>We've been working on the new C++0x SFINAE rules and the backward-compatibility consequences for mangling are a bit baffling: I'd like to get input from other implementors (particularly GCC) regarding direction in this area.

Let me start with a seemingly simple example:

	namespace N {
	  struct S { int x; } s;
	  template&lt;class T&gt; auto f(T p)-&gt;decltype(p.S::x);
	  void g() {
	    f(s);  // i.e. f&lt;S&gt;(s)
	  }
	}

GCC 4.5 encodes N::f&lt;N::S&gt; as &quot;_ZN1N1fINS_1SEEEDtdtfp_srS1_1xET_&quot; -- let me walk through how it gets there.

After the ABI prefix &quot;_Z&quot; comes the &lt;nested-name&gt; N::f&lt;N::S&gt; which is encoded as &quot;N1N1fINS_1SEEE&quot;.
Note how the first substitutable entity (code &quot;S_&quot;) is the namespace N, and that is used for the second reference to N in the template argument N::S (&quot;NS_1SE&quot;), which itself becomes the second substitutable entity (code &quot;S1_&quot;).

The return type follows (&quot;Dtdtfp_srS1_1xE&quot;) and breaks down as follows: &quot;Dt ... E&quot; for decltype of the member selection encoded as &quot;dtfp_srS1_1x&quot;, &quot;dt&quot; for the dot operator on &quot;fp_&quot; (an encoding that means &quot;first function parameter&quot;), which leaves &quot;srS1_1x&quot; to represent &quot;S::x&quot; in this case.

Now the &quot;sr&quot; (&quot;scope resolution&quot;) code in the current ABI spec is specified through the following productions:

  &lt;expression&gt; ::= ...
               ::= sr &lt;type&gt; &lt;unqualified-name&gt;                    # dependent name
               ::= sr &lt;type&gt; &lt;unqualified-name&gt; &lt;template-args&gt;    # dependent template-id

This seems reasonable here because p in &quot;p.S::x&quot; has a template-dependent type, and so the &quot;x&quot; can be considered a dependent name.  &quot;S&quot; is apparently N::S, which, as noted above, is encoded as &quot;S1_&quot; because of the substitution rules.

Now, if I'd written the declaration of f by writing S as N::S:

	  template&lt;class T&gt; auto f(T p)-&gt;decltype(p.N::S::x);

the reasoning above holds and I'd find the same mangled name (and, indeed, GCC 4.5 does that).

However, the language definition throws a wrench in that reasoning: S in &quot;p.S::x&quot; must be looked up both using ordinary lookup and in the scope of whatever class type p ends up having (see 3.4.5/4 in the current working paper for the language), and if the two lookups end up finding different things, it is an error... except that since this is a SFINAE case it just means that that function instance drops out of the overload set.  Similarly, N::S in &quot;p.N::S&quot; must be looked up twice, and may end up being invalid.  But since S and N::S can yield different results in the class-scope lookup, it means that the two template declarations above are distinct!

Let me demonstrate this by example with a slight modification of the example above (still valid C++0x, but requires support for the new SFINAE rules):

	namespace N {
	  struct S { int x; struct N { enum S {}; }; } s;                   // Note the added nested class N.
	  template&lt;class T&gt; auto f(T p)-&gt;decltype(p.S::x) { return 1; }     // #1
	  template&lt;class T&gt; auto f(T p)-&gt;decltype(p.N::S::x) { return 2; }  // #2
	  void g() {
	    f(s);  // Calls #1
	  }
	}

When substituting N::S for T in template #1, the lookup of S in the scope of p finds the type S itself, which is the same type as what ordinary lookup finds: That substitution is fine.

When substituting N::S for T in template #2, the lookup of N::S in the scope of p finds an enumeration, which conflicts with the class type N::S found through ordinary lookup: The substitution of #2 therefore fails, and the only remaining candidate for the call is #1.

The existing ABI (and, hence, existing practice) is therefore not adequate for the C++0x language rules: We have to break backward compatibility in this area.

(We also looked at changing the C++0x language itself to avoid the problem, but it's a really sell (&quot;please change the language in an obscure/subtle way because it raises some obscure/subtle backward-compatibility issue in our mangling scheme&quot;).)

Instead of the current approach, we'll have to encode the source form of the selected member in cases like these.  I.e., p.S::x, p.N::S, and even p.::N::S::x must all be encoded differently even though for a valid instantiation they must all resolve to the same thing.  I'm thinking that we should continue to use the sr prefix, but what follows would be a &lt;type&gt; only if the qualifier is a template parameter (p.T::x) or a decltype construct (p.decltype(xx)::x); otherwise, it would encode an &quot;unresolved name&quot; (which is not a candidate for substitution; e.g., N::S might be encoded as &quot;N1N1SE&quot; even though there is a substitution code for the type ::N::S.


Thoughts?

P.S.: What mitigates the bad news of ABI breakage is that I don't think code like this is widespread yet (and the cases that do occur are probably inlined calls).
