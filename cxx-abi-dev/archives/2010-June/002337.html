Actually, I'd prefer not to introduce a divergence from the standard notion of trivial, and therefore &quot;deleted destructors&quot; would be nontrivial.


&gt;<i> We definitely don't want to change the C++98-compatible cases (implicit trivial, implicit non-trivial, user-provided).  But what if the copy constructor is deleted, or there is no copy constructor because it's suppressed by a user-declared move constructor?

</I>&gt;<i> It seems natural to change &quot;a non-trivial copy constructor or destructor&quot; to &quot;a non-trivial, non-deleted copy constructor, move constructor or destructor&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OTOH, that would make changing a no-copy class's copy constructor or destructor from private and undefined to deleted an ABI change,
</I>

Right.  Again, I'd prefer to just keep with what falls out of the standard notion of &quot;trivial copy constructor&quot; (a deleted copy constructor is nontrivial, and hence the associated class is passed by invisible reference).


&gt;<i> so perhaps we should treat deleted functions as non-trivial for this purpose (and array new cookies).  I am ambivalent on this point.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But we definitely need to do something about classes with a move constructor and no copy constructor.  I think we want to add &quot;move constructor&quot; to the list as above, for consistency with the definition of &quot;trivially copyable&quot;.
</I>

Right.  Below is an e-mail I posted a while back about that.

Hello again,

In 3.1.1 and 3.1.4, the ABI specifies that &quot;by value&quot; class type parameters and class type return values are passed via the address of a reference if the class type has
	(a) a nontrivial destructor, or
	(b) a nontrivial copy constructor.

Should we now also add to that:
	(c) a (nontrivial) move constructor
?

(There is currently no notion of &quot;trivial move constructor&quot;, but I think there are suggestions to introduce that in the future.)

	Daveed
