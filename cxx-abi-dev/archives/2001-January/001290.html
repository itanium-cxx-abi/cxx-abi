<PRE>Sadly, the VTT algorithms in the C++ abi are broken, and fail on diamond
shaped graphs.

The VTT only contains secondary vtable pointers for bases with virtual bases
or with virtual functions overridden along a virtual path from that base to the
base for which the VTT belongs. Unfortunately, that means bases within a virtual
heirarchy can have an undefined vtable. This breaks dynamic_cast and typeid
within the base under construction. Consider

struct A {virtual void f();} // nearly empty
struct B1 : virtual A {};	// A will be primary base
struct B2 : virtual A { B2 ();}; // A will be primary base
struct C : B1, B2 {};    // B1 will be primary base, A in B1 will be active
B2::B2 ()
{
   A *aptr = this;
   
   assert (typeid (*aptr) == typeid (*this));
   assert (dynamic_cast &lt;void *&gt; (aptr) == this);
}


both those asserts will fail, as virtual base A's vtable will not be initialized
inside B2's ctor, and will have information remaining from B1's constructing.

We need to change 2.6.2 part 3 to include secondary virtual pointers for
each subobject X with either (a) virtual bases or (b) reachable via a virtual path
from D. All the stuff about overriding virtual functions along a virtual path
is unneeded.

I attach a patch to abi.html to this effect. I've also added a note about primary
virtual bases. It reworks the example given at the end of 2.6.2.
