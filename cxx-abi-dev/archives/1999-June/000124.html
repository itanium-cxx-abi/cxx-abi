<PRE>In C++, there are various things with external linkage that can be defined
in multiple translation units, while the ODR requires that the program
behave as if there were only a single definition.  From the user's
standpoint, this applies to inlines and templates.  From the
implementation's perspective, it also applies to things like vtables and
RTTI info.  There are several ways of dealing with such &quot;vague linkage&quot;
items:

1) Emit them everywhere and only use one.
2) Use some heuristic to decide where to emit them.
3) Use a database to decide where to emit them.
4) Generate them at link time.

#3 and #4 are feasible for templates, but I consider them too heavyweight
to be used for other things.

The typical heuristic for #2 is &quot;with the first non-inline, non-abstract
virtual function in the class&quot;.  This works pretty well, but fails for
classes that have no such virtual function, and for non-member inlines.
Worse, the heuristic may produce different results in different translation
units, as a method could be defined inline after being declared non-inline
in the class body.  So we have to handle multiple copies in some cases
anyway.

The way to handle this in standard ELF is weak symbols.  If all definitions
are marked weak, the linker will choose one and the others will just sit
there taking up space.

Christophe mentioned the other day that the HP compiler used the typical
heuristic above, and handled the case of different results by encoding the
key function in the vtable name.  But this seems unnecessary when we can
just choose one of multiple defns.

A better solution than weak symbols alone would be to set things up so that
the linker will discard the extra copies.  Various existing implementations
of this are:

1) The Microsoft PE/COFF defn includes support for COMDAT sections, which
   key off of the first symbol defined.  One copy is chosen, others are
   discarded.  You can specify conditions to the linker (must have same
   contents, must have same size)
2) The IBM XCOFF platform includes a garbage-collecting linker; sections
   that are not referenced in a sweep from main are discarded.  In xlC,
   template instantiations are emitted in separate sections, with encoded
   names; at link time, one copy is renamed to the real mangled name, and
   the others are discarded by garbage collection.

The GNU ELF toolchain does a variant of #1 here; any sections with names
beginning with &quot;.gnu.linkonce.&quot; are treated as COMDAT sections.  It seems
more sensible to me to key off of the section name than the first symbol
name as in PE.

The GNU linker recently added support for garbage collection, and I've been
thinking about changing our handling of vague linkage to make use of it,
but haven't.

I propose that the ia64 base ABI be extended to provide for either COMDAT
sections or garbage collection, and that we use that support for vague
linkage.

I further propose that we not use heuristics to cut down the number of
copies ahead of time; they usually work fine, but can cause problems in
some situations, such as when not all of the class's members are in the
same symbol space.  Does the ia64 ABI provide for controlling which symbols
are exported from a shared library?

A side issue: What do we want to do with dynamically-initialized variables?
The same thing, or use COMMON?  I propose COMMON.

A side issue is how to handle local static variables in inlines.  G++
currently avoids this issue by suppressing inlining of functions with
local statics, if we don't want to do that, we'll need to specify a
mangling for the statics, and handle multiple copies like we do above.
