<PRE>Here is a note explaining some subtleties (and possible solutions) in
combining V-pointer sharing and covariant polymorphic returns.
I still owe a note about the handling of nasty dynamic_cast cases
(hopefully later tonight).

	Daveed


A Hairy Example
---------------
Covariant polymorphic returns consists in having a virtual overrider function 
override the type it returns with a type that is derived from all of the return 
types declared for the overridden (virtual) functions. The complication that 
this brings is that the static return types of the caller and callee can no 
longer be determined at compile-time.

The following valid C++ code illustrates this: 

        // Return types: 
        struct S {}; 
        struct T {}; 
        struct U: S, virtual T { virtual ~U(); }; 

        // Covariant classes: 
        struct A { 
           virtual S&amp; f(); 
        }; 

        struct B { 
           virtual T&amp; f(); 
        }; 

        struct D: A, B { 
           virtual U&amp; f(); // Covariant with both A::f and B::f 
        }; 

        void g(A *p) { 
           S &amp;r = p-&gt;f(); // OK 
           // U &amp;r2 = p-&gt;f();  // Would be illegal 
        } 

        void g(B *p) { 
           T &amp;r = p-&gt;f(); 
        }; 

        void g(D *p) { 
           U &amp;r1 = p-&gt;f(); // OK 
           S &amp;r2 = p-&gt;f(); // OK 
           T &amp;r3 = p-&gt;f(); // OK 
        }

Consider the call in g(B*) above (&quot;T &amp;r = p-&gt;f();&quot;): the callee could very well 
end up being D::f and thus it is fair to say that (a) the caller does not know 
the static type declared for the callee, and (b) the callee does not know which 
type will be expected by the caller. Note also that the dynamic type of the 
returned object may be different from either of these types (i.e., D::f might 
return an object that is further derived from U).


Solution for the Single Inheritance case 
----------------------------------------
The first component of a solution to the above problem is to seek a common point 
of reference for the caller and the callee. In particular, both can look back along
the derivation chain to find which base the original, non-overriding virtual function
introduced as a return type. In the case of single inheritance, the callee can ensure
that the returned address points to that original base, and the caller can perform
the inverse transformation (if needed). 

Here is an example: 

        // Return types: 
        struct T {}; 
        struct U: T { virtual ~U(); }; 

        // Covariant classes: 
        struct B { 
           virtual T&amp; f(); // Original base is T 
        }; 

        struct D: B { 
           virtual U&amp; f(); // Covariant return; definition of f 
                           // will implicitly adjust to original 
                           // base subobject of type T. 
        }; 

        void g(B *p) { 
           T &amp;r = p-&gt;f(); // OK, caller needs no adjustment 
        }; 

        void g(D *p) { 
           U &amp;r1 = p-&gt;f(); // OK, adjust from T to U since callee
                           // is really returning the original base 
                           // type T. 
           T &amp;r3 = p-&gt;f(); // OK, no adjustment needed. 
        }

Unfortunately, this doesn't always work for virtual bases because it is not possible
to cast from a non-polymorphic virtual base to a derived type (since the base is not
polymorphic, there is no vtable to find the location of enclosing derivations. The
proposed solution in that case is for the callee to also return the adjustment from
the original base to the first enclosing virtual derivation in a second return register
(assuming the calling conventions allow for at least two return registers).
If the caller determines that a deeper derivation must be cast to, it can do so
since the returned adjustment provides access to a virtual table. The following
example illustrates such an intricate situation: 

        // Return types: 
        struct VB {}; 
        struct VD: virtual VB {}; 
        struct VX: virtual VD {}; 

        // Covariant classes: 
        struct B { 
           virtual VB* f(); // Unaware of derivations; hence returns a VB* only. 
        }; 

        struct D: B { 
           virtual VD* f() { 
              return new VX; // Returns a VB* and the offset to the VD* subobject. 
           } 
        }; 

        struct X: D { 
           virtual VX* f() { 
              return new VX; // Returns a VB* and the offset to the VD* subobject. 
           }                 // Adjustment to VX* is done on caller (or thunk) side. 
        }; 

        void f1(B *p) { 
           VB *r = p-&gt;f(); // No problem, a VB* is what you get. 
        } 

        void f2(D *p) { 
           VB *r1 = p-&gt;f(); // No problem either. 
           VD *r2 = p-&gt;f(); // A VB* is received in first return register; 
        }                   // add the second register to find the VD*. 

        void f3(X *p) { 
           VB *r1 = p-&gt;f(); // No problem either. 
           VD *r2 = p-&gt;f(); // A VB* is received in the first return register; 
                            // add the second register to find the VD*. 
           VX *r3 = p-&gt;f(); // A VB* is received in the first return register; 
                            // add the second register and we're now pointing 
                            // to a vtable pointer in the VD subobject. Hence 
                            // a simplified &quot;dynamic_cast&quot;-like operation can 
        }                   // determine the VX*

This general approach still leaves some options open: 

  . The adjustment to VD* or VX* above could be done by the caller directly, or in
    a thunk that would be dispatched from an added vtable slot. I would suggest to
    not introduce thunks unless needed for multiple inheritance cases (see later).
  . The second return value (the adjustment) is only needed if the original primary
    virtual base does not have a vtable pointer. However, even if there is a virtual
    table it could be used. I would suggest to create the second return value only
    when absolutely needed. This avoids the sometimes unnecessary cost on the callee
    side. 


Multiple Inheritance 
--------------------
Reconsider the introductory example. Since there are now multiple derivation
branches, we can start with the single inheritance convention where the &quot;original
base&quot; is meant to be &quot;the original leftmost base&quot; (i.e., along the primary derivation
path). This leaves the case where a base along a secondary derivation path is
returned: 

        // Return types: 
        struct S {}; 
        struct T {}; 
        struct U: S, virtual T { virtual ~U(); }; 

        // Covariant classes: 
        struct A { 
           virtual S&amp; f(); 
        }; 

        struct B { 
           virtual T&amp; f(); 
        }; 

        struct D: A, B { 
           virtual U&amp; f(); // Covariant with both A::f and B::f 
        };

        void g(A *p) { 
           S &amp;r = p-&gt;f(); // Enabled with mechanism above 
        } 

        void g(B *p) { 
           T &amp;r = p-&gt;f(); // Still a problem! May return an S&amp;. 
        };

        void g(D *p) { 
           U &amp;r1 = p-&gt;f(); // Enabled 
           S &amp;r2 = p-&gt;f(); // Enabled 
           T &amp;r3 = p-&gt;f(); // Enabled: add second return value to get a U&amp;, 
        }                  // then cast to T&amp; (through vtable info).

Note that &quot;leftmost original base&quot; means &quot;the type returned by the leftmost
non-overridden virtual function&quot;, and not the &quot;leftmost base&quot; of the returned type.
I.e., if A::f were to return T, then T would be the type pointed to by the physical
return value of D::f.

For secondary derivation paths, we are saved by the fact that those virtual calls are
dispatched through a secondary---and therefore different---virtual table. Hence, in
such cases the secondary vtable slot can be made to point to a stub/thunk that adapts
the return value: 

        void g(B *p) { 
           T &amp;r = p-&gt;f(); 
           // Secondary vtable entry for D::B::f point to stub. 
           // This stub calls D::f which returns an S&amp;, adjusts 
           // it to a U&amp;, and then back to T&amp;. 
        };

The double adjustment may be collapsed into a single constant adjustment if there are
no virtual bases involved. Otherwise it may be required to use the second return
value and/or the virtual base offset stored in the returned object vtable. In this
particular example, we get: 

        S-&gt;U: ret_ptr -= sizeof(void*) 
        U-&gt;T: ret_ptr += (*(ptrdiff_t**)ret_ptr)[-1]

&lt;end of note&gt;
