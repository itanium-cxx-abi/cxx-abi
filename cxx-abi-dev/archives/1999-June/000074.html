<PRE>Attached is an updated summary page in HTML.  I'll send PDF separately.
Changes include:

- Updated participant info
- More detail on objectives, based somewhat on our discussion.
- A list of action items from the meeting.
- Additional issues from email and meeting.
- Sketchy notes on procedure from the meeting.

I have a bunch of requests to help us move this effort along:

- Check the action item list and pursue any that belong to you.
  Nothing is listed for IBM, but if you have ABI-related
  documentation that you're willing to share, please do so.

- Check the issue list.  Look at the &quot;class&quot; field and let me know
  if there are missing impacts or mistakes (could be due to either
  cut-and-paste or ignorance).  Make sure that I've included
  any that you brought up (or that you remember anyone else
  bringing up).  Also, I took notes on the issues, but not on who
  raised them -- if I got sources wrong, and you care, let me know.

- There are at least a couple of issues that discussion suggested
  are not real on grounds that they address undefined behaviors
  (B-3 and D-7, at least).  As a non-expert, I will wait to close
  them until someone puts up a clear explanation of the grounds
  for doing so.  Please do...

- Take a look at the prioritization discussion under Objectives
  and comment.  If the classification seems reasonable, I'll take
  a shot at prioritizing the issues based on it.

- Next week we'll dive into the object layout issues.  Matt will
  describe alternatives, and I hope suggest preferences, for the
  first half dozen.  It is my intent to maintain another document
  tracking the discussion on the individual issues, for which I
  need information in writing (HTML best, text fine, FrameMaker,
  Word, PDF probably OK -- if I figure out how to embed them).
  Also, a written description is the best way to get people to
  consider and react to an issue.  So I'd like people to start
  signing up to do at least simple write-ups of the issues.  It
  is very desirable to keep a backlog of well-documented issues
  to discuss, so the sooner the better.  Send me your
  reservations...

- In anticipation of communication about orange info:  If you need
  to send something, but can't produce password-protected PDF, you
  can send it to me or probably Sunil Saxena at Intel and we can
  do it.  To send it to us, PGP encryption works.  My key is:

  Others that have PGP keys might want to share them.  I think we
  may want to discuss exception handling sooner rather than later
  because of the potential impact on the base ABI, so Priti's
  action item to get the n-way NDA in place is important.

- By the way, since I'm not intimately familiar with the Standard,
  I probably have used ad-hoc terminology where there is common
  terminology available.  Please let me know, and I'll fix it.

- Does anyone know how to shrink the font inside HTML tables
  (for a whole table, or a whole document, without a &lt;font&gt;
  tag in each cell)?  If so, I'd love to hear from you.  (And
  if you don't want me to do it, say so, but I'd still like to
  know how.)

For all the minor corrections and bits of info requested above,
if they don't need general discussion, feel free to just send them
to me for incorportation rather than inundating the reflector.

Thanks to all for your participation!
