<PRE>Jim: One issue that library providers face, though, is whether they
need to provide a thread-safe in addition to the higher performance
and possibly thread-unsafe version of their library.  I.e. it may
still be helpful to provide a consistent model for library vendors,
possibly at some initialization-time performance overhead, if it
resolves the dilemma (without taxing the application performance
beyond initialization.)

 &gt; Thanks for the clarification.  I understand now, and have added the
 &gt; issue as G-4.  However, I share Mike's scepticism about tackling the
 &gt; problem, for reasons I'll explain below.
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; From: <A HREF="http://sourcerytools.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/cxx-abi-dev">jls at sco.com</A> (Jonathan Schilling)

 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; The standard is mute on multiple threads of control in general, so 
 &gt; &gt; there is no requirement in the language to support what I'm talking
 &gt; &gt; about. But as a practical matter compilers have to do it (Watcom gave
 &gt; &gt; a paper on their approach during the standardization process, if I
 &gt; &gt; remember).
 &gt; 
 &gt; It's not obvious to me that compilers have to do it.  As Mike points
 &gt; out, it is permissible to leave the responsibility to the users.  And,
 &gt; I'm inclined to believe that's the right solution.  What it would take
 &gt; to change my mind would be a solution which addressed the following
 &gt; concerns:
 &gt; 
 &gt; First, it should not cause noticible cost in non-multithreaded
 &gt; programs.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Second, it should not cause unnecessary cost in multithreaded programs.
 &gt; This requires more elaboration.  Even in multithreaded programs, I
 &gt; would guess that most relevant initializations would not really be
 &gt; exposed to multiple simultaneous executions, and a careful user could
 &gt; avoid locking.  Further, in many of the remaining cases, I would expect
 &gt; a careful user to be able to use a single lock for a collection of
 &gt; object initializations, giving the per-object locking I would expect
 &gt; from an automatic approach higher overhead than necessary.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Of course, the argument might be made that doing this automatically
 &gt; simplifies the life of the multithreading programmer, but I suspect
 &gt; that's less useful than it appears.  This particular case (explicit
 &gt; dynamic initialization of local static variables) is a relatively minor
 &gt; example of a whole class of program behaviors subject to the same
 &gt; issues, where most of them are strictly user code cases that the
 &gt; compiler has no chance of identifying, let alone solving.  So the user
 &gt; is going to have to be aware of these issues and their solutions
 &gt; anyway, and leaving this example to him doesn't seem onerous.
 &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; However, it's not very effective to discuss the problem in the
 &gt; abstract.  If someone has a specific proposal for solving the problem,
 &gt; submit it, and we can discuss concrete characteristics instead of
 &gt; speculations.
