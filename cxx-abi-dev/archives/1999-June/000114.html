Jason did send the message, and there has been a discussion about this
issue on c++std-core.  Jason's message was c++std-core-8101.

My take on the discussion is that everyone agrees there is a defect in
the standard, because it can reasonably be interpreted both ways, and that
the standard needs to be clarified.  Several people expressed support for
the interpretation under which this proposed layout rule is legal.  My
guess (perhaps Mike and Jason could comment, since they've both seen the
discussion too) is that's how this issue will eventually be resolve.
