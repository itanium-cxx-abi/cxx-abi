How does this work in shared libraries? Is GC done at load time?

I guess that means the answer to the above is &quot;yes&quot;?

Do you thread-protect it? (just curious)

I'm afraid so. An idiom to protect against initialization order
dependencies is:
	inline X&amp; x() {
		static X lx;
		return lx;
	}

(and use x() instead of a global x everywhere.)

I've seen increased usage of this and it would be nice if it could be
inlined.
