<PRE>I'd like to make some claims about function scope static constructor calls in
multithreaded environments.  I personally can't recall ever having used
such a construct, which somewhat substantiates my claims, but also implies
some lack of certainty.  I'd be interested in hearing any arguments to the
contrary.

I believe that these arguments imply that this problem is not important
enough to warrant added ABI complexity or overhead for sequential code.

Consider the following skeletal example:

f(int x) { static foo a(...); ... }

1) If the constructor argument doesn't depend on the function parameter,
and the code behaves reasonably, it should be possible to rewrite this as

static foo a(...);

f(int x) { ... }

2) If I read the standard correctly (and that's a big disclaimer), the compiler
is entitled to perform the above transformation under conditions that are
usually true, but hard for the compiler to deduce.  Thus code that relies on
the initialization occurring during the execution of f is usually broken.

3) Thus the foo constructor cannot rely on its caller holding any locks.
It must explicitly acquire any locks it needs.

4) It is far preferable to write the transformed form with a file scope
static variable to start with.  The initial form risks deadlock, since
f may be called with locks held which the constructor can't assume are held.
If it needs one of those locks it will need to reacquire it.  With default
mutex semantics that results in deadlock with itself.
(If locks may be reentered, it may fail in a more subtle manner since the
foo constructor may acquire a monitor lock whose monitor invariant doesn't
hold.)

5) File scope static constructor calls aren't a problem and require no locking,
since they are executed in a single thread before main is called or before
dlopen returns.  (Forking a thread in a static constructor should probably
be disallowed.  Threads may not have been fully initialized, among other
issues.)

6) Static function scope constructor calls which depend on function arguments
are likely to involve a race condition anyway, if multiple instances of
the function can be invoked concurrently.  Any of the calls might determine
the constructor parameters.  Thus these aren't very interesting either.
And if they are really needed, they can be replaced with a file scope static
constructor call plus an assignment.
