Oops, yes.  You're quite right; only one empty-except-for-the-vptr
base class at offset 0, and that's true whether it's a non-virtual
base class with virtual functions, or a virtual base class.

Another goof I just noticed: if it's a virtual but nonpolymorphic
base class then we can't put it at offset 0, because the derived
class has a vptr at offset 0 and the base class doesn't.

I don't know whether this sort of reordering is a good idea.  Part of this
exercise is to see if we can come up with a simple enough heuristic so that
it's even worth running tests.
