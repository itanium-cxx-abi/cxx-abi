C++0x, the upcoming revision of the ISO C++ standard, is going to
require some additions to the C++ ABI. Here's the first one, which is
quite trivial:

I suggest that rvalue references be mangled as 'RR' (lvalue references
are mangled as 'R'). Since we can't have a reference-to-reference,
there is no ambiguity.

     <type> ::= RR <type>   # rvalue reference-to

I agree with this.

That makes sense to me too.

I'd suggest that you prepare an HTML patch to reflect that.  We don't
have a formal procedure for amending the ABI document, but, in practice,
what we do is:

1. Post the HTML patch with a description here.
2. Wait a week or so.
3. Check it in.

The patch follows, waiting a week is easy... but where would I check this in?

Generating this is easy.  Demangling would need a simple look ahead to
look for both.

Would using up another capital letter solve this trivial issue and save
more space?  We could use "B".  ;-)

(We do have two letter combos in TV TT TI TS and in ctor/dtor names.)

I also agree.
Also I meant to add that for Decimal Floating Point, Mark and I have spoke
late last year about adding the following mangling:


     Decimal32:           "p"
     Decimal64:            "q"
     Decimal128:         "r"

Basically, we looked at the holes that remain in the one letter case and
chose this rather then multiple letters. I should also write one up for
this per Mark's instructions.

Will that "r" conflict with C99 restrict?
This of course would be even harder to demangle.

It may be time to use double letters.  Unfortunately "D" is taken, unless
you want something like Dp Dq Dr.  Or using "B". :-)

It shouldn't, actually; existing demanglers should just demangle it as a 
reference to reference, which happens to be the syntax for an rvalue 
reference.

I think we considered this and C99 restrict cannot exist on its own. It 
must be a restrict on a type hence it is a qualifier. So the conflict 
should not exist, in my opinion. I hope we are not wrong.

Its a little more work, but not much more.

It just so happens that those spaces exist in the current name mangling 
and we have started using it in our product. Anyone know if GNU is using 
the same mangling for decimal floating types?

You can't, only I can. :-)  That's not because I'm in charge (I'm not!)
-- it's because the repository is behind a CodeSourcery firewall.  That
could change; we picked up the HTML from SGI at some point when it
didn't otherwise have a home.

When the week is up, ping me, and I'll check it in for you.

FWIW, the reference implementation in the Metrowerks compiler was using
"O" to mangle rvalue refs.

Do you have the parsing algorithm?
That way everyone can be consistent.  And if any errors in your logic,
everyone can help find them.

It seems like the rule is:
Restrict should only be mangled with pointers and references.
Arrays in function parms degrade to pointers.

And top level qualifiers in template parms are removed??

This would leave:
    U r V K  followed by P or R

So if "r" is followed by V K P or R, it is restrict, else Decimal128?

And we don't have to worry about foo(restrict int) or r then i.

That's a strong argument. I'm perfectly happy with "O", then.

Although it would not be entirely ambiguous, I would very not going  
that route.

How about Df, Dd, Dg to parallel float, double, and __float128?

I like it too.
So if we are looking for a type and we find "D", we get the next.
If looking for a functions, D#.

While I believe this encoding is slightly better, unfortunately, we have 
productized this based on the earlier agreement (although Mark did advise 
me to send a braodcastl) that the encoding was acceptable. We also believe 
GNU has also chosen the same encoding based on our advice. So we have 
released a first product out based on this and changing it now would lead 
to binary incompatibility. I realize now I should have sought the opinion 
of this group and for that I deeply apologize.

I realize this is not the best encoding, but many other single letter 
encoding do not represent their actual names. We agree that this is not 
ambiguous. So for the sake of precedence, can we agree on the original 
encoding?
