Subject: PATCH: Add explicit revision number to title
Message-ID: <200310060555.h965trdO015284@doubledemon.codesourcery.com>


I was asked to add a revision number to the title of the C++ ABI
document so that it was easy to refer to a particular version.  I've
done that here, using the expedient technique of referencing the CVS
revision of the document.

Hi,

Is it legal to call __cxa_delete{,2,3} with a first argument of NULL?

I think it should be allowed so that the callers don't have to do the NULL-test.

Either way, it would be nice if abi.html was explicit.

(I assume you meant __cxa_vec_delete*?)

Our versions tests inside.

Scott, Dennis --

The short answer is that the ABI does not really specify the behavior of
these functions when the first argument is NULL.

The G++ runtime does not presently permit the first argument to be NULL.
Changing that would be OK; it's backwards compatible.

If there's no objection, we can update the specification to indicate that
the "array_address" parameter may be NULL.
