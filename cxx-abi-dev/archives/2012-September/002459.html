In order to do this (in a backwards compatible way) I think we'd need to add new versions of __cxa_vec_new2/__cxa_vec_new3 where the element_count is signed and the number of initializers in the array is passed as a new argument.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) A new routine, say __cxa_vec_new_check, that takes a signed element_count, element_size, and number of initialized elements and does all necessary checks, throwing std::bad_array_new_length if required, otherwise returning.  Compilers would insert a call to the new routine before any call to __cxa_vec_new* (when the number of elements isn't known at compile time).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that option 2 is out (doesn't handle placement new[]), and option 3 has problems with signed/unsigned number of elements cases.  It appears that option 1 has had the most support (and gives the most flexibility).  Any objections (or other proposals)?
</I>
I wouldn't say option 2 is *out*, it's just not *sufficient*, in the same ways that __cxa_vec_new was never sufficient.

Would you mind writing up a formal proposal (or even a patch)?  At a high level I think the required changes are:

1) Adding the new __cxa_throw_bad_array_new_length routine.  There's a still an open question here, I think:  it's a better user experience if std::bad_array_new_length carries the length argument.  Unfortunately (a) that's a bit complicated to encode as an operand to the routine, because we'd also need to track whether that's signed or unsigned, and (b) it looks like libc++ doesn't have space for carrying this information, and libstdc++ apparently hasn't been revised for this rule change yet.

2) Including this behavior in the specification for __cxa_vec_new{,2,3}.

3) If desired, adding __cxa_vec_new_signed{,2,3}.

John.
