Thanks!

&gt;&gt;<i> At a high level I think the required changes are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Adding the new __cxa_throw_bad_array_new_length routine.  There's a still an open question here, I think:  it's a better user experience if std::bad_array_new_length carries the length argument.  Unfortunately (a) that's a bit complicated to encode as an operand to the routine, because we'd also need to track whether that's signed or unsigned, and (b) it looks like libc++ doesn't have space for carrying this information, and libstdc++ apparently hasn't been revised for this rule change yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We agree that having the length argument is desirable from a user's point of view, but it seems rather difficult for the compiler to convey this value to a library routine given that its type may be signed or unsigned and it may or may not be larger than size_t/ptrdiff_t.
</I>
I hadn't thought of the wider-than-size_t problem, although amusingly I did
remember that case when writing the bounds checks in clang.

Hmm.  At the risk of prescribing an overly complicated API, I would suggest:
  void __cxa_throw_bad_array_new_length(uintptr_t sizeData, int flags);
where 'flags' is:
  (sizeof(size) &lt;&lt; 1) | std::is_signed&lt;decltype(size)&gt;::value
and where sizeData is either:
 size, converted to a uintptr_t, if sizeof(size) &lt;= sizeof(uintptr_t), or
 &amp;size otherwise (throwing it in some temporary memory).
Converting to a uintptr_t means zero-extending or sign-extending as appropriate.

In the common case, this should be a pretty small addition to the call
sequence &#8212; on x86-64, for example, it would be (at worst) a register-register
move and a small immediate-to-register move.  I think that's a reasonable
sacrifice for the benefit of letting the ABI library report useful information in
the exception.

(ABI libraries will probably just saturate the bound value when storing it
in the exception, but this lets them decide how and when to do so.)

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Including this behavior in the specification for __cxa_vec_new{,2,3}.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) If desired, adding __cxa_vec_new_signed{,2,3}.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We're thinking that (because of the difficulty mentioned above) it's best to make one change: namely to add __cxa_throw_bad_array_new_length(void).  This pushes the responsibility to the compiler (where the type is known), and hopefully results in generated code that can be more easily optimized.  The existing routines would be unchanged.
</I>
Are you suggesting that the existing routines would not do this overflow
checking?  That makes them much less valuable for their intended
purposes of code-size optimization, because we'd still need several
checks and a whole second call sequence in the generated code.

I think the existing routines should do the check, assuming (as they must)
that they were given a valid unsigned value that fits within a size_t.  In
optimal code, this will just be some easily-predicted branch-on-overflow
instructions after the existing arithmetic;  it's peanuts compared to the rest
of the work.

If we're not going to add signed/oversized variants &#8212; both reasonable
choices, in my view &#8212; then the compiler can still use __cxa_vec_new*
as long as as it puts an appropriate check in front if either:
  - sizeof(size) &gt; sizeof(size_t)
  - decltype(size) is signed
This check is required if __cxa_throw_bad_array_new_length takes
any information about the size value and type.  I want it to take that
information.  However, if the consensus goes the other way and
__cxa_throw_bad_array_new_length does *not* take any information
about the size value, we can avoid this extra call in the extremely
common case that sizeof(element) &gt; 1, because the overflow check
in __cxa_vec_new* will automatically trigger for negative values.
Thus we can skip all checking relating to &quot;normal&quot; signed size values,
and for &quot;oversized&quot; size values we can simply saturate at -1 or some
other value which is guaranteed to fail to allocate.

John.
