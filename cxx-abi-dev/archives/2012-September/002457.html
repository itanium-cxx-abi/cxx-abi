<PRE>&gt;<i>From: John McCall &lt;<A HREF="http://sourcerytools.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/cxx-abi-dev">rjmccall at apple.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems strange that the code for signed is different than unsigned but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Standard says that signed could overflow and implementation defined.
</I>
&gt;<i>This conversation is about how to handle various possible values that the
</I>&gt;<i>first size expression in an array-new expression might take.  That expression
</I>&gt;<i>must be of integer type, but it's permitted to have signed integer type, and
</I>&gt;<i>so therefore can be negative.  In this case, C++11 demands that we throw
</I>&gt;<i>an exception of a certain type, std::bad_array_new_length.
</I>
&gt;<i>This is unrelated to the semantics of overflow in signed arithmetic.
</I>
I may been stretching it but I was suggesting that the Standard says
signed and unsigned are different under overflow so that indexing for
new with signed int could have negative values but not unsigned.

&gt;&gt;<i> But do we care?  For that architecture, the implementation-defined limit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be set to &lt; SIZE_MAX.
</I>
&gt;<i>On a platform with an intentionally constrained size_t, maybe not.
</I>
But if it is constrained, then wouldn't (size_t)-1 would always be invalid?
(Assuming size_t is constrained too.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I guess you could make an abstract argument that an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> array allocation which could have succeeded with a different bound
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> should always produce std::bad_array_new_length
</I>
&gt;<i>The point is that if the spec says &quot;throw a std::bad_array_new_length&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>we can't just throw a normal std::bad_alloc, because that's not compliant.
</I>
Yes, I was saying that the abstract argument wouldn't be valid because
some bounds would be bad_array_new_length and other (smaller) could be
bad_alloc.

Basically I see these ranges, some overlap:

1) allocation succeeds
2) bad_alloc: fails but at one time it is possible
3) bad_alloc: fails because of configuration limits or possible competing
              processes
4) bad_array_new_length: because just too big, overflow or negative

I.e. the Standard should not force an implementation to tell the difference
between 2) and 3).

&gt;<i>as I read it, the standard implies that we shouldn't even be calling
</I>&gt;<i>operator new[] if we have an invalid size, so we can't handle this by
</I>&gt;<i>just having operator new[] always throw the more specific exception.
</I>
Except operator new[] takes a size_t (which if unsigned) you would probably
is always assume was valid (since it doesn't overflow), and just let
the allocator check if too large.

&gt;<i>Possibly only constant after optimization, but yes, that's what I meant.
</I>John.

Ok, I was thinking of some type of inequality or range propagation that
could possibly bless it.  Or other advanced AI technology.
