Clang handles large unsigned.  This is compiler-generated code, so
we do know whether the value has signed type.  We currently do not
take advantage of the __cxa_vec_new routines.

Yeah, the assumption that SIZE_MAX is invalid to allocate is valid on
basically every flat-addressed platform;  it's just not guaranteed by the
standard.  But you can imagine a platform where individual allocations
can't exceed some size that's significantly smaller than a pointer &#8212;
for example, on an architecture with segmented or distributed memory,
or on a 64-bit platform that uses a 32-bit size_t because it doesn't care
about supporting &gt;4GB allocations.  It's not a possibility we should
blithely assume away just because it's not true of common platforms.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Don't get me wrong, adding new entrypoints is definitely cleaner.  The

Not that I know of; we've been quite careful.  In fact, I know of one area
where the Itanium ABI will probably have to forgo C++11 correctness in
pursuit of our compatibility goals (because of the expansion of the POD
definition).

</I>
Good question.  I guess you could make an abstract argument that an
array allocation which could have succeeded with a different bound
should always produce std::bad_array_new_length, but that would be
a very difficult (and expensive!) guarantee to make in practice.

You could make a serious argument that the only allocations which
*must* throw std::bad_array_new_length rather than just std::bad_alloc
are the cases where you can't call the allocator because the size_t
argument would be negative or otherwise mathematically wrong.
Certainly that would be preferable &#8212; if we're creating a new,
constant-sized array of PODs, we should just be able to call the
allocator instead of calling some entrypoint that will check the
length against some implementation limit just so that we can throw
the perfect exception type.

John.
