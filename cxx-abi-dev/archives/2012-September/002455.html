<PRE>&gt;<i>From: John McCall &lt;<A HREF="http://sourcerytools.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/cxx-abi-dev">rjmccall at apple.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>Clang handles large unsigned.  This is compiler-generated code, so
</I>&gt;<i>we do know whether the value has signed type.
</I>
It seems strange that the code for signed is different than unsigned but
the Standard says that signed could overflow and implementation defined.

&gt;<i>Yeah, the assumption that SIZE_MAX is invalid to allocate is valid on
</I>&gt;<i>basically every flat-addressed platform;  it's just not guaranteed by the
</I>&gt;<i>standard.  But you can imagine a platform where individual allocations
</I>&gt;<i>can't exceed some size that's significantly smaller than a pointer &#151;
</I>
I thought you got that backwards but if sizeof(size_t) is &lt; sizeof(uintmax),
then that would truncate that -1 to a much smaller.

But do we care?  For that architecture, the implementation-defined limit
can be set to &lt; SIZE_MAX.

&gt;<i>Not that I know of; we've been quite careful.
</I>
Ok, I'm guessing I'm thinking of stuff that didn't get in that was discussed
here.

&gt;<i>I guess you could make an abstract argument that an
</I>&gt;<i>array allocation which could have succeeded with a different bound
</I>&gt;<i>should always produce std::bad_array_new_length
</I>
But isn't that what bad_alloc also says, not enough memory, you greedy
pig?

Or is this the difference between &quot;new []&quot; and operator new/operator new[]?
The latter two know nothing about &quot;bounds&quot;.

&gt;<i>You could make a serious argument that the only allocations which
</I>&gt;<i>*must* throw std::bad_array_new_length rather than just std::bad_alloc
</I>&gt;<i>are the cases where you can't call the allocator because the size_t
</I>&gt;<i>argument would be negative or otherwise mathematically wrong.
</I>
Which means you have to be careful for overflows in the evaluation.

&gt;<i>if we're creating a new, constant-sized array of PODs,
</I>
(Compile time constant?)

&gt;<i> we should just be
</I>&gt;<i>able to call the allocator instead of calling some entrypoint that will
</I>&gt;<i>check the length against some implementation limit just so that we can
</I>&gt;<i>throw the perfect exception type.
</I>John.

Yes, just let malloc check.  ;-)
