This conversation is about how to handle various possible values that the
first size expression in an array-new expression might take.  That expression
must be of integer type, but it's permitted to have signed integer type, and
so therefore can be negative.  In this case, C++11 demands that we throw
an exception of a certain type, std::bad_array_new_length.

This is unrelated to the semantics of overflow in signed arithmetic.

</I>&gt;<i> I thought you got that backwards but if sizeof(size_t) is &lt; sizeof(uintmax),

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But do we care?  For that architecture, the implementation-defined limit
</I>&gt;<i> can be set to &lt; SIZE_MAX.
</I>
I'm not totally comfortable with the ABI making that decision;  it seems like
a decision that platform owners should make.  On a platform where
size_t is as large as the address space, sure.  On a platform with an
intentionally constrained size_t, maybe not.

&gt;&gt;<i> I guess you could make an abstract argument that an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> array allocation which could have succeeded with a different bound
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should always produce std::bad_array_new_length
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But isn't that what bad_alloc also says, not enough memory, you greedy
</I>&gt;<i> pig?
</I>
The point is that if the spec says &quot;throw a std::bad_array_new_length&quot;,
we can't just throw a normal std::bad_alloc, because that's not compliant.
A normal std::bad_alloc means &quot;we couldn't allocate that for some reason&quot;;
std::bad_array_new_length is basically a clarification that the failure was
inherent and cannot possibly succeed.

&gt;<i> Or is this the difference between &quot;new []&quot; and operator new/operator new[]?
</I>&gt;<i> The latter two know nothing about &quot;bounds&quot;.
</I>
It's part of the semantics of new[], yes.  operator new[] is not required to
throw this specific exception type.  Also, as I read it, the standard implies
that we shouldn't even be calling operator new[] if we have an invalid
size, so we can't handle this by just having operator new[] always
throw the more specific exception.

&gt;&gt;<i> You could make a serious argument that the only allocations which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *must* throw std::bad_array_new_length rather than just std::bad_alloc
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are the cases where you can't call the allocator because the size_t
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> argument would be negative or otherwise mathematically wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which means you have to be careful for overflows in the evaluation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if we're creating a new, constant-sized array of PODs,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Compile time constant?)
</I>
Possibly only constant after optimization, but yes, that's what I meant.

John.
