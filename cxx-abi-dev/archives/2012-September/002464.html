</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> At a high level I think the required changes are:

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Adding the new __cxa_throw_bad_array_new_length routine.  There's a still an open question here, I think:  it's a better user experience if std::bad_array_new_length carries the length argument.  Unfortunately (a) that's a bit complicated to encode as an operand to the routine, because we'd also need to track whether that's signed or unsigned, and (b) it looks like libc++ doesn't have space for carrying this information, and libstdc++ apparently hasn't been revised for this rule change yet.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We agree that having the length argument is desirable from a user's point of view, but it seems rather difficult for the compiler to convey this value to a library routine given that its type may be signed or unsigned and it may or may not be larger than size_t/ptrdiff_t.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hmm.  At the risk of prescribing an overly complicated API, I would suggest:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> void __cxa_throw_bad_array_new_length(uintptr_t sizeData, int flags);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where 'flags' is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (sizeof(size) &lt;&lt; 1) | std::is_signed&lt;decltype(size)&gt;::value
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and where sizeData is either:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> size, converted to a uintptr_t, if sizeof(size) &lt;= sizeof(uintptr_t), or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &amp;size otherwise (throwing it in some temporary memory).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Converting to a uintptr_t means zero-extending or sign-extending as appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a little leery of passing size (sizeData) in this fashion.  [Also, std::uintptr_t appears to be optional in the standard.]
</I>
Well, the simpler alternative is to saturate to a size_t/ssize_t (saturation being unnecessary unless the size is actually of a larger type than size_t) and just pass a flag indicating whether it's signed.  That inherently loses information, of course.

I know there are platforms which don't provide std::uintptr_t, but are there platforms which *can't* support std::uintptr_t?  That is, is this a real limitation or a &quot;some system headers are dumber than others&quot; limitation?

&gt;<i> If we went this route, I'd argue to separate flags above into two separate arguments.
</I>
Is there a good reason to, other than to get a slightly prettier-looking API?  I know that minimizing function arguments seems like a micro-optimization, but I'm not sure that's inappropriate in this context;  we certainly already have users that begrudge us the size of array-new, and this entire discussion is about making it larger.  Every instruction helps.

&gt;&gt;<i> If we're not going to add signed/oversized variants &#8212; both reasonable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> choices, in my view &#8212; then the compiler can still use __cxa_vec_new*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as long as as it puts an appropriate check in front if either:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - sizeof(size) &gt; sizeof(size_t)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - decltype(size) is signed
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - size &lt; number_of_initialized_elements
</I>
Oh, yes, of course.  If it's a nested array allocation, we need to do that
overflow check outside as well.

&gt;&gt;<i> This check is required if __cxa_throw_bad_array_new_length takes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any information about the size value and type.  I want it to take that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information.  However, if the consensus goes the other way and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> __cxa_throw_bad_array_new_length does *not* take any information
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about the size value, we can avoid this extra call in the extremely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> common case that sizeof(element) &gt; 1, because the overflow check
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in __cxa_vec_new* will automatically trigger for negative values.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thus we can skip all checking relating to &quot;normal&quot; signed size values,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and for &quot;oversized&quot; size values we can simply saturate at -1 or some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other value which is guaranteed to fail to allocate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming there are no architectures where this doesn't hold true, it sounds good to me.
</I>
We'd certainly have a lot more optimization flexibility if we don't try
to preserve the bad size value.  My worry is that we'd be *forcing* a poor
debugging experience on programmers &#8212; they'd have to reproduce the
problem in a debugger in order to have any idea what the bad value was.
I'll readily grant that this is already true for a large class of other bugs in C++.

Anyway, I've asked Howard Hinnant, Apple's C++ library maintainer, to
catch up on the discussion and weigh in.

John.
