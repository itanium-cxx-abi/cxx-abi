The problem with this is that there is no IA-64 ABI standard way to throw a std::bad_array_new_length exception once a violation has been detected (so we'd need to add something like __cxa_throw_bad_array_new_length).

</I>
Good point (though if we went with option 3 below it wouldn't be needed, but option 2 does not provide a complete solution).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For what it's worth, clang has always done this overflow checking (counting negative counts as an overflow in the signed-&gt;unsigned computation), although we don't reliably cause the right exception to be thrown &#8212; we simply pass (size_t) -1 to the allocation function.  Unfortunately, I think that's pretty obviously wrong under the standard, which seems to make it clear that we're not supposed to be calling the allocation function at all in this case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Have the runtime libraries do the checking and throw std::bad_array_new_length as needed.  In order to do this (in a backwards compatible way) I think we'd need to add new versions of __cxa_vec_new2/__cxa_vec_new3 where the element_count is signed and the number of initializers in the array is passed as a new argument.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, if we can use (size_t) -1 as a signal value, we don't need any new entrypoints.  That would be safe on any platform where there are values of size_t which cannot possibly be allocated;  of course, that property of size_t isn't guaranteed by the standard, although it's universally true these days, I think.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't get me wrong, adding new entrypoints is definitely cleaner.  The main problem with adding and using new entrypoints is that it means that old, C++98-compliant code being recompiled will suddenly require new things from the runtime, which introduces deployment problems.  And these problems are arguably inherent.   std::bad_array_new_length doesn't even exist in a C++98 standard library, so it's not like we can just emit our own copy of __cxa_throw_bad_array_new_length when we're not sure it exists;  we'd potentially have to emit the class itself, which has all sorts of nasty problems (e.g. because the RTTI is almost certainly a strong symbol in the stdlib's shared library).  So in practice we're talking about emitting this code only if it's known that the deployment target can handle it;  this is is okay for me, because clang has a relatively rich deployment-target model, but I wanted to raise the point.
</I>
One approach around the lack of std::bad_array_new_length could be to have __cxa_throw_bad_array_new_length throw std::bad_alloc as a stopgap solution.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) A new routine, say __cxa_vec_new_check, that takes a signed element_count, element_size, and number of initialized elements and does all necessary checks, throwing std::bad_array_new_length if required, otherwise returning.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would also need to know how much cookie to add.  The cookie causing an overflow would certainly be an example of &quot;the value of that expression is ... such that the size of the allocated object would exceed the implementation-defined limit&quot;.
</I>
Agreed; padding_size should be an argument if we go this way.

Mike.
