Subject: Mangling patches committed
Message-ID: <49E358D2.6030304@codesourcery.com>

Since discussion seems to have died down, I committed:

http://www.codesourcery.com/archives/cxx-abi-dev/msg02015.html

and:

http://www.codesourcery.com/archives/cxx-abi-dev/msg02049.html

and updated:

http://www.codesourcery.com/public/cxx-abi/abi.html

Are there any further patches outstanding that have reached consensus?

Thanks,
