<PRE>Following is an updated agenda.  The status pages are updated and on
the web (HTML and PDF) at:

      <A HREF="http://reality.sgi.com/dehnert_engr/cxx/cxx-summary.html">http://reality.sgi.com/dehnert_engr/cxx/cxx-summary.html</A>

The contact info page is now also there, in password-protected PDF only
for privacy.  The password is &quot;not an orc&quot;.

WARNING:  The next meeting (not this one) will likely have a different
phone number and building/conference room.  Look for it in the contact
info page if I forget to emphasize it.

As usual, most of the updates are in the ABI layout document, in red.
The significant changes from last meeting are:

  -- Added writeup of initialization priority in 3.3.4.4.
  -- Vague linkage for allocating constructors in 5.2.5.

Please take a careful look at the colored text, and raise any issues
you observe.

Take a look at the material associated with the following issues.
If you see something, please send it by email.

  1) D-17:  Is the runtime for bad_cast, bad_typeid OK?
     See the exception handling document abi-eh.html

  2) Mangling grammar modifications.  There's an outstanding ambiguity
     question, and the previously suggested solution would eliminate
     substitution for some names, we thought.  Can you look at this
     again, Alex?

  3) C-2:  Priority for constructors.  See the writeup in the
     Draft ABI, 3.3.4.4.  I attempted to fill some holes in our prior
     agreements, so there's new stuff here, and it needs checking.

  4) C-13:  Allocating constructors.  There's a new paragraph in 5.2.5.
     Is that enough?

  5) G-4:  Thread-safe data initialization.  See 3.3.2.  Observe that
     Christophe has suggested a more completely contained routine
     that also handles destructor registration, but what he provided
     was incomplete.  Can we make progress on this?

  6) F-3:  Mangling instantiation/specialization.
     F-4:  Empty throw specifications.
     F-10: Mangling return types.

We have the following issues without proposals.  Is there any interest
in pursuing them?

  7) F-5: ILP32 vs. LP64 mangling.  Christophe was going to think about
     whether to propose something specific, as I recall.

  8) G-1: Command line options.  Christophe was interested in
     specifying some common options for consistency.

Please also give some thought to what else (not on our lists) ought to
be considered at this point.

Note that it doesn't usually work to try to contact me by email
or phone the morning of the meeting, as I come directly from home.  If
you come in physically to the meeting, and the receptionist won't let
you come back to the conference room on your own, have her call the
conference room (it has a phone other than the one we use for the
meeting).
