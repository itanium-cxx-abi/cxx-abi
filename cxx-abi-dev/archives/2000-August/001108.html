<PRE>Jim,


Violent agreement there. I carefully selected the words &quot;has an impact on a
threading implementation&quot; to mean what you said: that the Standard does not tell
you what to do, but that the set of reasonable extensions is limited. Note that
this is all &quot;undefined behavior&quot; anyway. But my opinion is that it does not
encourage executing the same constructor twice.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The C++ Standard says so: you are not allowed to enter the same constructor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; twice. To me, this is one of the rare statements in the Standard that has an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; impact on a threading implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Without taking a position on the overall question, I think it's
</I>&gt;<i> important to comment on this statement.  The Standard does not
</I>&gt;<i> contemplate threading, period.  Some threading issues might be impacted
</I>&gt;<i> by &quot;reasonable&quot; extensions of what is stated, such as the one you cite,
</I>&gt;<i> but that was not the intent of the Standard, and should not be
</I>&gt;<i> interpreted that way.  The Standard describes a sequential language.
</I>&gt;<i> If it were extended to explicitly encompass threading, many issues
</I>&gt;<i> would need to be dealt with, and in that context, many of them might
</I>&gt;<i> not come out as pure &quot;extensions&quot; of the current language.  I think,
</I>&gt;<i> for instance, that an equally reasonable extension to this case would
</I>&gt;<i> be simply to forbid (make undefined) multiple threads from entering a
</I>&gt;<i> scope with local statics needing construction at the same time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is similar to the issues involved in global object destruction
</I>&gt;<i> when a DSO is unloaded early.  The Standard, which doesn't contemplate
</I>&gt;<i> DSOs, specifies a destructor order that isn't practical if the DSO goes
</I>&gt;<i> away early.  So we do something &quot;reasonable,&quot; albeit contrary to the
</I>&gt;<i> Standard.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The threading issues are the same.  We don't have guidance from the
</I>&gt;<i> Standard -- while we should certainly consider its principles as
</I>&gt;<i> guidance, we shouldn't consider its rules as determining choices in
</I>&gt;<i> areas to which they weren't intended to apply.
