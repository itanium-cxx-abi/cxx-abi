<h1>cxx-abi-dev Archives</h1>

<p>
Discussion and development of the <a href="../index.html">Itanium
C++ ABI</a> originally took place on a mailing list called
"cxx-abi-dev", as well as several offline meetings.  That mailing
list is now defunct, and discussion and development now happens 
on our
<a href="https://github.com/itanium-cxx-abi/cxx-abi/issues">
GitHub repository</a>.  However, the old discussions are still
valuable as a source of historical information about the ABI,
which can illuminate the intent of both the document and its
implementations.  Therefore, we include a complete archive of
the mailing list.

<p>
Currently, <a href="archives/index.html">these archives</a> are
just the output of the original pipermail mailing-list program.
This can make it frustrating to navigate a single conversation,
especially since the program tends to break conversations into
multiple threads if they happen to span the start of a new month.
We'd like to clean this up and present a somewhat more modern and
easy-to-read archive.  If we do, we'll leave the pipermail archives
so that links aren't disrupted.
